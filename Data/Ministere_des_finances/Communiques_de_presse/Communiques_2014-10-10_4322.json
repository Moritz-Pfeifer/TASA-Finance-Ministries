He reaffirms the French State’s credit quality.  \n \nMinister Sapin reminds that, “despite an economic situation which weighs on our fiscal balance, the \ngovernment remains committed to implementing announced policies. We are implementing the \nexpenditure savings we announced as well as the Responsibility and Solidarity Pact, so as to gain \nin competitiveness. We will pursue the needed reforms, to boost our medium term growth \nprospects. Against the background of a weak recovery and a abnormally low inflation in the euro \narea, each member country has to be up to its responsibilities and a coordinated economic policy \nhas to be set up at the European level in order to boost growth”. As noted by Standard and Poor’s, \nFrance has significant assets including a diversified economy, a financial sector adequately \ncapitalized as well as a high wealth per capita. \n \nMichel SAPIN reminds that the French debt is among the safest and most liquid ones in the world, \nwith a very contained debt service. It has a strong and deep investor base. Confidence from \ninvestors feeds on a consistent economic strategy that the government intends to pursue with \ndetermination. \n \n \n \n�\n�\n \nPress contact :  \n \nPress office of Michel SAPIN \n+33 (0)1 53 18 41 13 \n \nsec.mfcp-presse@cabinets.finances.gouv.fr  \n \n \n", "published_date": "2014-10-10", "section": "Communiques"}
