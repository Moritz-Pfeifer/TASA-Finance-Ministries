The first is entitled Lifting restrictions, because unneces-\nsary constraints are keeping France from getting back on track. This Bill is not about \nthe regulated professions or Sunday trading. Rather, it seeks to unlock growth poten-\ntial and economic activity by removing – in a very down-to-earth manner – a series \nof roadblocks in a wide range of sectors. The second section is called Investment, \nbecause our economy needs investment to really take off. We need to maintain \nFrance’s high-quality infrastructure, we need housing and, in order to modernise, we \nneed production-oriented investment. Finally, the third section is entitled Work. Job \ncreation must be our number one priority. We will never achieve the goals set out \nin this Bill without the support and the work of everyone who will benefit from it – \nFrance’s young people most of all. Therefore, it introduces reforms to certain parts \nof the labour market, including Sunday trading.\nThis Bill is designed to foster economic activity, not to put anyone at a disadvan-\ntage. Under its provisions, a great many sectors, including the regulated legal pro-\nfessions, retail trading and coach transport, will be opened up and streamlined. It \nprovides for reforms in a number of areas, such as regional development, insolvency \nproceedings, industrial tribunals and employee shareholding. It also introduces \ngreater transparency (which is needed to keep our economy in good shape) with \nrespect to fees charged by regulated professions and motorway operators. Finally, it \nwill boost financing for the economy through investment. Here the idea is to sell off \nsome of the government’s shareholdings and put the money into priority areas for \ninvestment, streamline and redirect employee savings, and improve employee access \nto shareholding.\nThis Bill will also introduce tangible and rapid improvements to the daily life of \nFrench citizens. To this end, once it has been voted on, the Minister will have the \norders it provides for – and which are ready – adopted as quickly as possible (the \nmajority within a timeframe of four months). The same will apply to their implement-\ning decrees which are currently being drawn up. By next summer, the fees of the \nregulated professions will be able to be adjusted downwards, there will be greater \ntransparency regarding toll roads and motorway concessions, industrial tribunal pro-\nceedings will be speeded up, new coach routes will run across France and a great \ndeal of red tape will be cut for businesses and households.\nThese are all concrete reforms which will very rapidly affect daily life. In addition \nto bolstering economic activity, they are designed to help restore confidence and \nhope. \nThe Bill is aimed at the marginalised members of society, young people, outsiders, \nthe most vulnerable, those who do not, at the moment, enjoy the same  economic \nopportunities as the most privileged for whom everything is always much easier. For \nthese people, the Bill will introduce, consolidate or uphold a number of real entitle-\nments. These include the ability to travel throughout France, as this should not be \nthe preserve of the most advantaged, the right to carry on the profession for which \nthey have been trained and to set up shop anywhere, and access to cheaper goods \nand services by increasing the retail offering and making fees of the regulated pro-\nfessions more transparent.\n\n4\nThe Bill fights vested interests and is progressive and forward-looking. It will give \na second, or even third, chance to those who did not know how, or were unable, \nto act the first time around.\nIt promotes transparency and streamlining, and caters for those whom the sys-\ntem has left behind. In a nutshell, it is an authentic socially-oriented Bill.  \nThe Bill is resolutely in step with the times and it addresses the actual issues with \nan eye to bringing about real change. It is not divisive or conflictual and it does \nnot stigmatise. It occupies the middle ground between what should be kept and \nwhat needs to be altered.\nLastly, the Bill does not close doors but opens windows, and it will do credit to \nthe Parliament’s majority.\n\n5\nContents\n3 \nEditorial\n7 \nLIFTING RESTRICTIONS\n9 \nReviewing fee schedules for regulated legal professions\n11 \n Making it easier for legal professionals to set up shop\n13 \n Broadening the scope of representation for lawyers to an entire appellate \njurisdiction\n15 \nCreating a new company lawyer status\n17 \n Offering legal and accounting professionals co-ownership opportunities\n19 \nDeregulating coach transport services\n23 \nStrengthening regulations governing road activities\n25 \nReducing the time and cost involved in obtaining a driving licence\n27 \n Increasing retail planning expertise to remove obstacles to competition  \nand give consumers more choice\n31 \n Meeting demand for middle-income social housing\n33 \nINVESTMENT\n35 \n Stimulating investment and speeding up major projects to boost growth\n37 \n Developing employee share ownership and fostering an entrepreneurial \nculture\n41 \n Streamlining company savings schemes to expand their use for financing \nthe real economy\n43 \nImproving management of government holdings\n45 \nWORK\n47 \nEasing restrictions on Sunday and evening work\n49 \nReforming the labour court system\n51 \n Providing greater protection for insolvency proceedings\n53 \nReclassifying the offence of obstruction\n\nLIFTING \nRESTRICTIONS\n\n7\nLIFTING \nRESTRICTIONS\n\n\n9\nReviewing fee schedules for regulated  \nlegal professions\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill introduces a new basis for setting and re-\nviewing the rates charged by regulated legal professions. The aim is to bring rates \ndown by adjusting them to the costs actually borne by legal professionals. New fee \nschedules will be set by decree in 2015, after the government has conferred with \nthe Competition Authority, whose powers are to be expanded.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nThe rates currently charged by admin-\nistrateurs judiciaires (official receivers), \ncommissaires-priseurs \njudiciaires \n(auc-\ntioneers), greffiers de tribunaux de com-\nmerce (commercial court clerks), huissiers \nde justice (process servers), mandataires \njudiciaires (trustees in bankruptcy) and \nnotaires (notaries) are set by the State.\nAs the rules for setting them were in \nmany cases established long ago (for \nnotaries in 1978, for receivers and trus-\ntees in 1985, for process servers in 1996), \nsome of the fees paid by citizens and \nbusinesses no longer have any relation-\nship to the costs actually borne by those \nprofessionals.\nFor example, a notary’s fees on the sale \nof a 100 sq. m. house in Clermont-Fer-\nrand almost doubled between 2000 \nand 2012, going from €1,039 to €1,9381 \nreflecting a proportional increase in \nproperty prices, but not any change in \nthe cost of providing the service.\nA few figures should illustrate this point:\n – Property prices increased by 253% \nbetween 1996 and 2013 on sales of \nolder homes\n – The number of property transactions \nand conveyances went from 500,000 \nsales of older units in 1992 to over \n800,000 in 2012\nMEASURES\nREVISION OF THE RULES FOR SETTING \nRATES\nFour principles will guide the process of \nsetting rates:\nPrinciple 1 – Reasonable margins. At the \nbehest of the Minister for the Economy, \nthe Competition Authority will be issu-\ning an opinion in early 2015 on margins \nin common practice among legal profes-\nsionals and recommending that rates be \nbrought more into line with actual costs.\nPrinciple 2 – A rate band. The regulated \nrates for routine services (e.g. low-value \nproperty purchases, affidavits) will set a \nceiling not to be exceeded, as they cur-\nrently do, but reductions may also be \nnegotiated down to a pre-established \nfloor to prevent dumping. This measure \nwill help lower rates, particularly once \nadditional notary offices open as a result \nof less stringent rules for setting up shop.\nPrinciple 3 – Solidarity. On the largest \ntransactions, notaries may still charge \nproportional rates (to be capped by \ndecree) to offset the obligation for the \nprofession to perform routine services \neither free of charge or for rates that lag \n1 According to the Inspection générale des finances (Inspectorate General of Finance), based on statistics collected by the Conseil supérieur du \nnotariat (the representative body for notaries).\n\n10\nbehind their actual cost (based on the \nprinciple of internal equalisation).\nPrinciple 4 – Periodic review. Rates will \nbe periodically reviewed to guarantee \nthat fees charged are related to the costs \nborne by professionals.\nPrinciple 5 – Transparency. Once the law \nauthorises negotiations over fees, legal \nprofessionals will be required to display \ntheir rates.\nThe \nCompetition \nAuthority \nwill \nbe \ngranted expanded powers to advise the \nGovernment on rate-setting. It may issue \nopinions on regulated rates, either at the \nrequest of the Minister for the Economy \nor on its own initiative.\nGOALS\nReduce the fees paid by individual and \nbusiness clients – Once reasonable mar-\ngins have been set, rates will go down.\nEnsure greater transparency for clients \n– The rates charged will more adequately \nreflect actual service provided and will \nnot exceed the level required to cover \nthe professional’s costs plus the equalisa-\ntion amount.\nGuarantee fair compensation for legal \nprofessionals – New rate schedules will \nbe established on the basis of objective \ncriteria and will include an equalisation \nsystem.\nEncourage \nlegal \nprofessionals \nto \nbecome more efficient, above all by \ninvesting more and organising their work \nmore effectively.\n\n11\nMaking it easier for legal professionals  \nto set up shop\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill simplifies the procedure for opening a legal \nprofessional’s office.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nA variety of legal professions (e.g. nota-\nries, process servers, auctioneers, trus-\ntees in bankruptcy) are currently subject \nto de jure or de facto restrictions to entry, \nreferred to in France as numerus clausus. \nWhat this means is that a professional \nwho wants to set up shop must either \npurchase an existing practice or join \none as a partner. New office openings \nare extremely uncommon, and for dec-\nades they have failed to keep pace with \neither population growth or the rise in \nthe number of legal graduates entering \nthe job market.\nCONSEQUENCES\nLimited service available\nThere are fewer and fewer legal offices, \nalthough the number of legal formal-\nities required has risen from year to \nyear as the population has grown.\nFrance’s population has increased by \n10 million in the past 30 years, and yet:\n – The number of notary’s offices has \ndeclined by 600 in less than 25 years \n(from 5,134 in 1981 to 4,564 in 2014), \neven as property sales have increased \nsignificantly in number and in value \n(by over 250% between 1998 and the \npresent)\n – The number of process server’s offices \nhas decreased by 18% since 1980. \nClosings in rural areas have not been \noffset by an equivalent increase in the \nnumber of new offices in urban areas, \nwhere there is higher demand for their \nservices.\nRegional disparities\nAs a result of such restrictions to entry, \nan adequate service offer is no longer \navailable across the entire country.\nFor example, the ratio of notaries to pop-\nulation varies by a factor of four, with \nno correlation to economic activity. The \nParis area is among the regions with the \nlowest ratios, although it has the high-\nest level of economic activity as well as \nthe highest property prices and trans-\naction volume. There are currently 4 \noffices per 100,000 inhabitants in the \nParis area (Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-\nde-Marne), versus 12 in the Aveyron \ndépartement.\nUnequal access\nThe limited supply created by the exist-\ning rules has made it increasingly expen-\nsive for newcomers to set up shop. \nBecause offices are either inherited or \nsold off to the highest bidder, profession-\nals with insufficient capital are effectively \nkept out of the market.\nImpediments to career growth, particu-\nlarly for women\nDue to existing restrictions, many pro-\nfessionals find it impossible to achieve \npartner status. They spend years as \nmere employees, often performing work \nsimilar to that of partners, but for much \nlower pay (the ranks of the salaried nota-\nries tripled between 2005 and 2012).\nThis is particularly true of women:\n – 80% of all notaries who are public \nofficers are men, whereas 84% of the \nemployees are women\n\n12\n – 80% of all auctioneers who are public \nofficers are men, whereas 56% of the \nemployees are women\n – 73% of all process servers who are \npublic officers are men, whereas 72% \nof the employees are women\nThe greying of legal professions\nThe current setup has created a “demo-\ngraphic wall” that France will hit within 5 \nto 10 years. It is therefore essential to set \nabout facilitating the opening of offices \nand creating new firms immediately.\n – The average age for notaries is 49\n – The average age for auctioneers is 53\n – The average age for process servers is 49\nMEASURES\nTomorrow, a salaried notary or a process \nserver with a diploma will be in a position \nto choose between buying an existing \noffice’s goodwill, as is common today, \nand opening their own office and build-\ning up their own client base, either alone \nor in partnership with other professionals.\nGOALS\nPromote equal opportunity and mobil-\nity within the profession, in particular \nfor young people and women.\nEnsure national coverage that matches \nlocal needs more adequately.\nEncourage the development of more \ninnovative service offers to meet the \nneeds of businesses and the population \nmore effectively.\nCreate jobs, both for legal professionals \nthemselves and in useful support func-\ntions (e.g. human resources, accounting, \nsecretarial work).\n\n13\nBroadening the scope of representation for \nlawyers to an entire appellate jurisdiction\nLawyers in France are only allowed to represent their clients officially in a specific \ntribunal de grande instance (TGI – court of first instance). This power of official re-\npresentation is referred to as postulation. The Growth and Economic Activity Bill ex-\ntends the principle of territorial monopoly governing lawyers’ postulation rights to \nencompass an entire appellate jurisdiction.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nPostulation is full and binding legal rep-\nresentation of a party in a given juris-\ndiction. In concrete terms, the lawyer \nacts on behalf of his or her clients in a \nspecific jurisdiction by preparing docu-\nments and carrying out actions required \nfor their claims.\nLawyers are currently free to plead any-\nwhere in France. However, their role in \npostulation is still subject to a territo-\nrial monopoly. A lawyer may only “pos-\ntulate” before the court of first instance \n(TGI) of the bar to which he or she is \nadmitted and in the court of appeals \nabove that TGI.\nCONSEQUENCES\nAn illogical, economically inefficient \nsystem\nThis situation leads to a number of incon-\ngruities. A lawyer retained to plead \nbefore a TGI other than the TGI of the \nbar of which he or she is a member, even \nif it is only a few dozen miles away, is \nrequired to have a “local lawyer” prepare \nthe necessary procedural documents.\nFor example, a member of the Saint-\nMalo bar is not allowed to postulate \nin the TGI in nearby Rennes, nor is a \nmember of the Annecy bar in the TGI in \nnearby Chambéry.\nA dual expense that decreases the cli-\nent’s disposable income\nThe client therefore has to pay two law-\nyers: one who pleads in court, present-\ning the facts of the case, and another \nwho “postulates”, taking the necessary \nprocedural steps. The latter’s remuner-\nation is based on a regulated local rate \ninvolving a combination of fixed fees and \nproportional fees. But rather than being \ncalculated as a percentage of the settle-\nment amount ultimately set by the judge, \nthe proportional component is equal to \na percentage of the initial claims, which \nmay be extremely high.\nAn outmoded system\nAll lawyers admitted to the bar of a given \ncourt of appeals may appear directly \nin that court, but they are not allowed \nto do so before the TGI in the same \njurisdiction.\n\n14\nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity \nBill will not undermine the postulation \nmonopoly held by lawyers, who will con-\ntinue to be the only ones with the right \nto carry out formalities for their clients.\nIt will, however, broaden the territorial \nscope for postulation to encompass an \nentire appellate jurisdiction by allowing \nlawyers to plead before all TGIs within \nthis jurisdiction. At the same time, while \nrates will no longer be regulated, lawyers \nwill henceforth be required to provide a \nwritten fee agreement before taking on a \ncase.\nGOALS\nReduce expenses for citizens. A 30% \ndecrease in litigation costs would save \nlitigants a total of €43.2 million annually.\nEnhance the transparency of fee infor-\nmation provided by lawyers to their \nclients.\n\n15\nCreating a new company lawyer status\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill creates a new company lawyer status that as-\ncribes legal privilege, or attorney-client privilege, to lawyers in the work they per-\nform for companies.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nLegal professionals today can only work \nfor companies as salaried staff members. \nLikewise, a lawyer who wishes to work for \na company must give up his or her status \nas a lawyer and become a mere salaried \nlegal professional.\nIn many countries, several of them in \nEurope (Germany, Spain, the United \nKingdom), opinions and analyses are \nissued by legal professionals with the \nspecial status of company lawyer. A com-\npany lawyer is at one and the same \ntime a lawyer providing independent \nanalysis and an employee of a com-\npany. The professional confidentiality \nrule applies to his or her legal opin-\nions. More importantly, this status \nallows company lawyers to take part in \nexchanges of confidential information \nwith other lawyers in connection with \ntheir work for a company.\nCONSEQUENCES\nThe current non-existence of a company \nlawyer status places French companies \nat a disadvantage. Companies’ opinions \nare in no way protected and cannot be \nincluded in negotiations or discussions \ncarried out by lawyers representing \ncompanies.\nIn addition, the lack of company lawyer \nstatus in France makes companies less \ninclined to have in-house legal profes-\nsionals draft memorandums, because \nthey fear that such documents may be \nused against them in legal proceedings.\nLastly, this state of affairs may render for-\neign business partners and subsidiaries \nsomewhat wary in their dealings with a \nFrench company’s legal department. In \nextreme cases, it may even induce com-\npanies to relocate their legal depart-\nments to countries that offer company \nlawyers adequate protection (e.g. Ger-\nmany, Denmark, Spain, the United King-\ndom, Sweden). The outcome is that the \nentire value chain in France gets penal-\nised, as legal departments shifted abroad \ntend to make use of non-French lawyers \nand legal professionals.\n\n16\nMEASURES\nA company lawyer status that extends \ncounsel-client privilege to opinions and \ndocuments produced by lawyers will be \nestablished.\n – A company lawyer must either hold a \nCAPA professional lawyer’s certificate \nor have at least five years of experi-\nence working as a legal professional \nfor companies\n – He or she must be admitted to the bar \non a special company lawyers’ list\n – He or she is required to uphold \nthe code of ethics and professional \nresponsibility for lawyers\n – He or she must work exclusively for a \nspecific company\n – He or she is prohibited from having his \nor her own clientele and from pleading \nin court\nGOALS\nCreate new vistas and greater career \nflexibility for junior lawyers. Holders of \nthe CAPA professional lawyer’s certificate \nwill be in a position to choose between \njoining a law firm and working for a com-\npany, with the option of shifting easily \nbetween the two while remaining mem-\nbers of the bar. Roughly 25% of all young \nholders of the CAPA certificate join the \nsalaried staff of companies, as they are \nunable to find employment in line with \ntheir qualifications.\nOffer companies new opportunities to \nenhance their efficiency, security and \ncompetitive strength.\nMake France more competitive from a \nlegal standpoint, both in Europe and \nbeyond.\n\n17\nOffering legal and accounting professionals  \nco-ownership opportunities\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill will create the basis for co-ownership between \nlegal and accounting professionals.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nThe \ncurrent \nrules \non \nbecoming \na \nco-owner of a firm in a regulated profes-\nsion are highly restrictive:\n – It is impossible for professionals to \nbecome joint owners unless they prac-\ntice together within the same firm\n – It is impossible to establish tie-ups \namong regulated professions operat-\ning in the same “family of activity”\nThe \ncurrent \nsystem \ndiscourages \ninter-professional relations. It leaves \nfew options open to professionals, par-\nticularly younger ones who are trying \nto get a start in their field. It makes it \nharder for them to invest, innovate and \nenhance their skills.\nMEASURES\nAuthorise co-ownership by legal and to \na lesser degree accounting profession-\nals (entitled to one third of voting rights \nat most).\nFor example, a lawyer and a notary will \nhave the opportunity to become partners \nin the same structure, and therefore to \nmake all-inclusive offers to their clients. \nFrom the professionals’ standpoint, \nsuch structures will be particularly advan-\ntageous in medium-sized cities. They will \nmake it easier for junior professionals to \nget started and for company ownership \nto be transferred. Firms of this kind will \nbe able to achieve critical mass faster \nand to maintain it afterwards. For busi-\nnesses and individual clients, this change \nwill mean more comprehensive service of \nthe kind they often need.\nAuthorise \npersons \npractising \nthe \nsame profession, but within different \nstructures, to become co-owners of a \nsociété d’exercice libéral (SEL – profes-\nsional practice).\nFor example, a young notary who wants \nto open an office could take on a notary \nworking for a different structure as \nco-owner.\nAuthorise professionals in Europe with \nrecognised qualifications who prac-\ntise the same profession to become \nco-owners of a société de participa-\ntions financières de profession libérale \n(SPFPL) – in essence a holding company \nthat invests in regulated professional \npractices.\n\n18\nGOALS\nEncourage the creation of firms by \nfacilitating access to new sources of \nfunding.\nThis \nchange \nwill \ngive \nprofession-\nals opportunities to access additional \nresources that they can use to invest, hire \nstaff, expand their premises and the like.\nMake it easier to open offices and \nenhance national coverage.\nExpanded co-ownership opportunities \nfor legal professionals will foster more \neffective sharing of expenses and make \nit easier to open an office and maintain \noperations in areas with low population \ndensity.\nBroaden the range of services available \nto citizens and businesses by creating \nsynergy among professionals within a \nsingle firm.\nEncourage investment, particularly in \non-line platforms.\nCo-ownership opportunities will give \nlegal professionals the means and the \nresources they need to establish on-line \nplatforms and gain a foothold in this \npromising new segment.\nBoost the influence of French compa-\nnies in Europe.\nThe additional financial and legal means \navailable to French legal professionals \nwill provide them with the resources they \nneed to develop their work in Europe, \ntogether with their counterparts from \nother countries. Nationally-based firms \nwill be in a position to compete with \nexisting European organisations through \nexternal growth and thus to handle a \ngreater volume of activity.\n\n19\nDeregulating coach transport services\nOpening up the operation of national coach routes, to provide French passengers \nwith a transport service to supplement the use of trains and private cars.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nToday, 83% of journeys in France are by \nprivate car and 17% by public transport. \nThe French use public transport less than \ntheir European neighbours (14.9% in \nFrance versus 16.7% on average). Aside \nfrom train and air travel, coach travel \nremains almost entirely dominated by \ntransport authorities (at central govern-\nment, regional, département and munic-\nipal levels), which determine routes and \nprices.\nThe system is cumbersome and com-\nplex, and it limits the development of \nnational routes.\nSince 2011, private-sector operators have \nbeen able to operate national routes as \npart of an international service, subject \nto three conditions:\nThey cannot offer intra-regional services\nJourneys within France are authorised \nas part of a primarily international route \nprovided that a) the proportion of pas-\nsengers in the coach travelling within \nFrance is not more than 50% and b) jour-\nneys within France must account for less \nthan 50% of the operator’s revenue\nAfter consultation with the local author-\nities, the Directorate General for Infra-\nstructure, Transport and Maritime Affairs \n(DGITM) grants permission. The Autorité \nde la Concurrence (Competition Author-\nity) emphasises that the theoretical sev-\nen-month timeframe is often exceeded \nfor national routes.\nCONSEQUENCES\nCoach travel accounts for a very small \nproportion of overall travel in France:\nCoaches carried around 110,000 passen-\ngers in 2013\nThey accounted for 0.0005% of total \nlong-distance journeys\nTrains (excluding TGVs) carry ten times as \nmany passengers per day as coaches do \nin one year\nInadequate public transport services \nmean that the French use private cars \nmore than other European citizens (83% \nin France versus 78% in Italy, which has a \nhighly developed motorway system)\nExisting \ncoach \nroutes \nare \nat \nfull \ncapacity (e.g. Paris–Lille) and do not \nmeet \npassenger \ndemand \nbecause \nof the constraints that prevent their \ndevelopment.\nThere is a real need. For example, get-\nting from Clermont-Ferrand to Péri-\ngueux by train takes 5 hours, including \none change. The same journey by coach \nwould take around 3 hours.\n\n20\nYear  \nof deregulation\nMarket characteristics\nUK\n1985\n30 million passengers per year /  \n4% of long-distance journeys\nSweden\n1999\n2 million passengers per year /  \n5% of intercity journeys\nGermany\n2013\n180% increase in the number of passengers  \nin one year (8.3 million in 2013)\nA threefold increase in the number  \nof coach licences\nTo get from Bordeaux to Lyon, train \npassengers must change in either Paris \nor Tours. A coach route could connect \nBordeaux and Lyon directly, with major \neconomic benefits.\nFrance is lagging behind other Euro-\npean countries in terms of intercity \ncoach services, restricting the activity \nand mobility of the French people.\nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \nallows coach routes to operate across \nFrance.\nAll efforts will be focused on the public \ninterest. As regards intra-regional routes, \nthe transport authority will be able to \nban coach routes that would compete \nwith public transport services (coach or \nregional express train). Such bans would \nbe subject to the agreement of the \nnew Rail and Road Activities Regulation \nAuthority (ARAFER), a successor to ARAF \nthat will have extended powers. The new \nAuthority will conduct an economic sur-\nvey to determine whether routes would \nundermine a public service.\n\n21\nCOACHES ARE NOT NECESSARILY MORE POLLUTING  \nTHAN TRAINS, AND POLLUTE MUCH LESS THAN PRIVATE CARS\nToday’s coaches must meet very demanding emissions standards and produce \nless CO2 than private cars even when they are far from full (on average, when \nthey carry eight passengers or more). The comparison with train travel de-\npends on how full and modern the train is. By way of example, however, for re-\ngional routes, CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre are around 30% lower for \ncoaches than trains.\nSince 1 January, all new coaches sold in France (and in Europe) must comply \nwith the Euro 6 standard, which has sharply reduced emission limits, particularly \nparticle emissions. As a result, particle emissions from today’s coaches are half \nthose in 2013, and one-thirteenth of the level seen in 2001.\nCoach\nTrain\nJourney time\n3 hours\n1 hour\nTotal price\n€114 (-70 %)\n€396\nGOALS\nMake it easier for French people to \ntravel within France: in a year’s time, \nfive million people could be travelling by \ncoach annually.\nMake travel less expensive: coach travel \nis cheap for its users, which is of particu-\nlar benefit for young people. On aver-\nage, a coach journey costs half the \nprice of a train journey (based on the \nten most popular coach routes). Coach \npassengers currently consist mainly of \nyoung people: half of all coach passen-\ngers are under 30. Coach travel will also \nappeal to people travelling alone and \nretired people.\nExample: a return journey from Lille to Paris for four people, reserved two days in \nadvance.\nAfter the initial build-up period, the \nopening-up of the coach sector will boost \npassengers’ purchasing power by around \n€800 million per year.\nExpand economic activity in the sector \nand create jobs in France: according to \nthe Competition Authority, deregulat-\ning the sector could create some 10,000 \njobs, mainly at local level.\n\n\n23\nStrengthening regulations governing  \nroad activities\nImproving governance of motorway tolls for the benefit of users, and of motorway \nworks contracts. Allowing the opening-up of the coach passenger transport sector.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nMOTORWAYS\nMotorway companies are authorised \nto collect tolls in return for financing, \ndesigning, building, extending, maintain-\ning and operating their networks.\nIn 2013 and 2014, the Cour des comptes \n(Government Audit Office) and the \nCompetition Authority noted a sharp \nincrease in toll prices (for both individ-\nuals and companies) that was out of pro-\nportion to motorway companies’ actual \ncosts. According to their research:\n – Toll prices have risen on average 35% \nfaster than inflation – a 25% increase \nin ten years. Consumer spending on \ntolls has increased 50% in nominal \nterms over the same period.\n – Motorway \nconcession \ncompanies’ \nturnover has continued to rise even in \ncases where motorway traffic has fallen \nsharply, solely because of toll increases\nThat situation is partly due to the way \nnegotiations take place between motor-\nway companies and the French gov-\nernment \nregarding \namendments \nto \nconcession contracts. Both the Govern-\nment Audit Office and the Competition \nAuthority have concluded that negotia-\ntions are too much in favour of motor-\nway concession companies, to the \ndetriment of users and the government’s \nfinancial interests.\nAs regards works contracts, the Compe-\ntition Authority noted a lack of trans-\nparency and checks on the way those \ncontracts are awarded, which could help \nexplain why a large proportion of them \nare awarded to construction groups to \nwhich some motorway concession com-\npanies belong. The powers of the cur-\nrent Commission Nationale des Marchés \n(National Contracts Commission) are \nvery limited compared with those usually \ngiven to a regulator. \nCOACHES\nPrivate-sector intercity passenger trans-\nport is currently only authorised in very \nspecific segments – such as national \njourneys forming part of an international \nroute – and is subject to authorisation by \nthe public authorities. \n\n24\nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \nexpands the remit of the Rail Activities \nRegulation Authority (ARAF) – which is \nin the process of becoming the Rail and \nRoad Activities Regulation Authority \n(ARAFER) – to include the regulation of \nthe motorway sector and of regular road \npassenger transport services.\nARAFER’s role will include monitoring \nprice negotiations with motorway con-\ncession companies, and to ensure:\n – An improved framework and greater \nfinancial control regarding motorway \ninvestments offset by toll increases. \nThis will prevent motorway concession \ncompanies receiving excessive remu-\nneration from investments that are not \nput out to competitive tender and will \nlimit toll increases.\n – A more effective response to com-\npetition issues in the public works \nsector, caused by the fact that most \nconcession companies belong to con-\nstruction groups, by introducing a \ngenuine regulatory framework for \nthose companies’ contracts, involving \noversight by an independent regula-\ntor and a lower threshold above which \nwork must be put out to competitive \ntender.\nARAFER will also analyse the impact \nof deregulating coach routes (inter-re-\ngional and intra-regional) and will be able \nto propose measures that allow trans-\nport authorities (at central government, \nregional or département level) to ban or \nlimit intra-regional services if they expect \nthat this will compromise the finances of \na subsidised public service – such as a \nregional express train service. This will \nallow controlled expansion of coach ser-\nvices, ensuring that they do not threaten \nthe economic equilibrium of a subsidised \npublic service at the intra-regional level.\nThe cross-cutting powers granted to \nARAFER by the Bill will enable it to per-\nform audits and surveys, collect data and \ncarry out any necessary research in the \nsector, as well as carrying out checks, \ninvestigations and taking action as it is \nentitled to do in the rail sector.\nGOALS\nLimit increases in motorway tolls for \nthe benefit of consumers, individuals \nand companies, particularly road haul-\nage companies.\nEnsure that companies in the construc-\ntion sector, particularly SMEs, have \nbetter access to contracts awarded \nby motorway companies by requiring \nmore of those contracts to be put out \nto competitive tender.\nAllow development of intercity coach \nservices, while ensuring that they do \nnot compromise the finances of a sub-\nsidised public service, i.e. a transport \nservice on the same route within a \ngiven region.\n\n25\nReducing the time and cost involved in \nobtaining a driving licence\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill addresses one of the measures announced \nby the government in June 2013 to reduce waiting times for B-licence driving tests.\nSTATE OF PLAY \nExcessively long waiting times for tests\nToday’s 1,300 driving licence and road \nsafety inspectors are unable to provide \nenough practical B-licence tests to meet \ndemand. The amount of time that an \napplicant has to wait between two tests \nhas been rising constantly in the last few \nyears.\nSome figures:\n – Three months (98 days) on average \nnationally in 2013\n – Five months on average in cer-\ntain \ndépartements, \nincluding \nthe \nÎle-de-France\n – One and a half months on average in \nother European countries\n – Over one million applicants for the  \nB-licence test each year in France\nWaiting times increase the cost of \nobtaining a licence.\nLearning to drive is expensive. In France, \nit costs €1,600 on average to obtain \na licence, and the figures vary widely. \nThe cost is lower for those who choose \naccompanied driving or who drive an \nautomatic car, for example (around \n€1,100), but can be much higher for \nthose who fail their first test after tradi-\ntional instruction.\nApplicants facing a waiting time of sev-\neral months are effectively forced to have \na large number of lessons to maintain \ntheir level of driving ability. For the 40% \nof applicants who fail their first test, \nthe price of failure is around €200 per \nmonth until they are able to take their \nsecond test.\n\n26\nMEASURES\nThe Bill sets out the following conditions:\n – Authorised operators must be able \nto show that they have the practical \nresources to organise tests, that they \nare impartial towards candidates and \nindependent with respect to those \nwho provide or market driving instruc-\ntion services\n – They must organise tests in accord-\nance with the programme determined \nby the authorities, using examiners \nwho meet minimum qualification and \nprofessional integrity standards\n – Fees charged by authorised operators \nfor sitting tests will be regulated by \ndecree after approval by the Competi-\ntion Authority\n – Anyone may work as an examiner sub-\nject to the authorisation conditions set \nby the authorities, and authorisation \nmay be withdrawn or suspended if \nexaminers fail to meet their obligations\nTogether, these measures will increase \nthe potential number of B-licence tests \nby up to 170,000 per year, by reassign-\ning examiners who previously provided \nother tests.\nGOALS\nReduce waiting times for driving tests \nand thereby cut the cost of obtaining a \nlicence.\n – Driving test waiting times: for every \nmonth the waiting time is reduced, an \napplicant saves €200 on average\n – Waiting times for retaking the test: \nreduced to 45 days in two years’ time\nMake it easier to obtain a licence in \norder to increase social and profes-\nsional mobility.\nMobility remains crucial for people want-\ning to start work, and is therefore a major \nissue. Having a driving licence is a recruit-\nment criterion for 65% of employers.\nGENERATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY\nThe measure will generate economic \nactivity by opening up a new area of \nactivity to the private sector.\nOn 13 June 2014, the government announced plans to reform the entire dri-\nving licence system, to make it more accessible, modern and transparent. Toge-\nther, the measures should reduce the waiting time for a driving test to 45 days \nin two years’ time.\nTo achieve that objective, the reform aims to make examiners focus on B-licence \ntests, by allowing other authorised operators to provide highway code tests, \nand practical tests for certain HGV licences. \n\n27\nIncreasing retail planning expertise  \nto remove obstacles to competition  \nand give consumers more choice\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill will remove one of the obstacles to compe-\ntition arising from retail planning rules, by extending the Competition Authority’s \nremit.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nCurrently, the location of shops depends \non local planning rules, along with spe-\ncific retail planning procedures including \napproval by retail development commit-\ntees at département and national lev-\nels. Those rules are produced by local \nelected officials and form part of plan-\nning documents, particularly PLUs (local \nplanning policies) and SCOTs (regional \nconsistency plans). They are intended to \nensure harmonious development within \na region while making that region more \ncommercially attractive.\nPLANNING DOCUMENTS\n – PLU (Plan local d’urbanisme - local planning policy)\n – PLUI (Plan local d’urbanisme intercommunal - intercommunal local planning policy)\n – SCOT (Schéma de cohérence territoriale - regional consistency plan)\n \n–  Schéma de développement régional d’Île-de-France (Paris region develop-\nment plan)\nCONSEQUENCES\nCompetition between retailers is some-\ntimes insufficient.\nEfforts to develop local economies and \nimprove retail offerings do not ade-\nquately take into account independent \nanalysis of consumer needs. That situa-\ntion means that local markets become \nfocused on existing large stores, due \nto obstacles that prevent new players \nfrom entering the market but fail to \nbenefit small town-centre retailers.\n\n28\nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \ngives the Competition Authority new \npowers to ensure that the location \nof stores supports fair competition \nand provides consumers with genuine \nchoice.\nThe Competition Authority, acting on \nits own initiative or in cases referred to \nit by the prefect or the Minister for the \nEconomy, may give an opinion on draft \nplanning documents setting out rules \nfor land use and the breakdown of retail \nspace, before they are finally adopted. \nThe Competition Authority will therefore \nbe able to check that those documents \nwill help maintain an acceptable level of \ncompetition. Its opinions will be made \npublic.\nA DIVERSE RETAIL OFFERING PROMOTES PRICE COMPETITION\nConsumer organisation UFC-Que Choisir has shown the effect of price compe-\ntition by comparing two stores from the same group, both located in Marseille, \nbut with differing proximity to rival retailers. At the store with no local compe-\ntition, the price of the average shopping basket is 3.5% higher than the group \naverage. At the store that has comparable rivals located nearby, the price of the \naverage shopping basket is 1.9% lower than the group average. The price dif-\nference between the two stores is 5.4%. \nKEY FIGURES\n1.4: the average number of shops per 1,000 inhabitants in France, compared \nwith 2.6 in Europe.\nThe retail sector accounts for 11% of France’s GDP and employs almost 3 mil-\nlion people. \n\n29\nTHE STRUCTURAL INJUNCTION\nThe structural injunction is a new measure introduced by the Growth and Eco-\nnomic Activity Bill, supplementing provisions relating to retail planning. It will \nenable the Competition Authority to force operators with over 50% of a \ngiven retail market to dispose of part of their business, if such a disposal is \nthe only way to restore effective competition and after major retailers with do-\nminant positions in a given sector have made proposals to adjust their pricing \npolicy or to reorganise their local operations. \nGOALS\nGive consumers the most diverse retail \noffering possible, thereby maximising \nprice competition and the resulting \nincrease in purchasing power.\nAllow new players to enter the market, \npromoting competition and innovation.\nAllow suppliers access to a larger number \nof stores.\nResolve situations where regional-level \ndialogue has proved to be difficult.\n\n\n31\nMeeting demand for middle-income  \nsocial housing\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill aims to increase considerably the supply of \nmiddle-income social housing in France, in order to support the construction in-\ndustry, make it easier and cheaper for middle-class families to find housing and re-\nduce pressure on social housing.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nMiddle-income social housing means \nrent-controlled \nhousing \nfor \nfamilies \nwhose incomes are too high to qualify for \nsocial housing, but too low to be able to \nafford or remain in private housing.\nThere is an urgent need for this type \nof housing, and there are particular \nshortages in certain areas including the \nGreater Paris region.\nVarious methods have been adopted \nto solve the problem. The French gov-\nernment’s Order of 20 February 2014 \nintroduced a new middle-income social \nhousing regime.\nTax incentives – including a 10% VAT rate \nand a 20-year exemption from the TFPB \ndeveloped land tax – were also intro-\nduced on 1 January 2014 to encourage \nthe construction of such housing.\nMEASURES\nMAKE INCENTIVES SIMPLER AND EASIER \nTO UNDERSTAND\nThe aim is to make the various meas-\nures adopted in support of middle-in-\ncome social housing easy to understand \nand consistent, to encourage their use. \nAccordingly, the zoning condition appli-\ncable to the Order of 20 February 2014 \nwill be removed. That condition came \non top of the zoning condition provided \nfor by tax legislation on middle-income \nsocial housing, and made the system \nharder to understand.\nMake the system more effective to \nensure rapid growth in middle-income \nsocial housing\nThe measures contained in the Bill, or to \nbe taken under executive powers, will:\n – Allow subsidiaries created by social \nhousing organisations to build, man-\nage and acquire middle-income social \nhousing. They will be able to manage \naffordable housing through manage-\nment contracts.\n – Encourage growth in middle-income \nsocial housing by enabling towns to \nspecify, within their planning docu-\nments, areas within which permitted \nfloorspace will be increased by up to \n30% for these housing projects\n – Allow local authorities to implement \nlocal policies encouraging the devel-\nopment \nof \nmiddle-income \nsocial \nhousing. Those responsible for admin-\nistering government incentives for \nrented social housing will be able to \n\n32\nplay a local role in allocating afforda-\nble housing incentives. Where require-\nments identified in local housing plans \njustify it, they will be able to take part \nin creating this kind of housing.\nINCREASE PERMITTED FLOORSPACE\nThrough their planning documents, towns may decide to create districts within \nwhich building rights (i.e. the amount of floorspace permitted for a given area \nof land) are increased unilaterally and on a one-off basis by 30% for middle-in-\ncome social housing projects.\nGOALS\n – Support activity in the construction \nsector, which was particularly hard-hit \nby the economic crisis\n – Make it easier for middle-class families \nto access suitable, affordable housing\n – Remove obstacles preventing families \nfrom moving – some people are forced \nto turn down jobs that would involve \nmoving house because they are unable \nto find alternative housing\n – Create \na \nless \nabrupt \ntransition \nbetween social housing and private \nhousing, with the aim of eventually \nreducing pressure on social housing\n\n33\nINVESTMENT\n\n\n35\nStimulating investment and speeding up  \nmajor projects to boost growth\nSTATE OF PLAY\nToday, major industrial and urban \ndevelopment projects take far too long \nto complete, because of complex regu-\nlations, such as the authorisations associ-\nated with building permits and the many \nenvironmental assessments required. \nIn order to meet project sponsors’ \nexpectations, and still maintain a high \nlevel of environmental protection, the \nGovernment has undertaken modernisa-\ntion of environmental law as part of the \nsimplification policy being monitored \nand driven by the Administrative Stream-\nlining Board. Innovative experimental \nprogrammes involving a single authori-\nsation for Installations Classified on Envi-\nronmental Protection Grounds have been \nimplemented for specified periods and \nparts of the country, and project certifi-\ncates were initiated in 2014. \nThe single authorisation, particularly \nin the case of Installations Classified on \nEnvironmental Protection Grounds, is \nintended to coordinate the examination \nof applications and the issuance of a sin-\ngle document covering all of the deci-\nsions that the government has to make \nwhen authorising such projects. \nThe project certificate is a guaranteed \nresponse issued within two months by \nthe Prefect of the département. This doc-\nument ensures that the economic part-\nners in a given project will have a single \npoint of contact in the administration. It \ngives a commitment about the required \nprocedures and processing times. It also \nprovides legal security in the form of \nguarantee that, with few exceptions, no \nchanges will be made to the relevant \nlaws in the 18 months following the issu-\nance of the certificate and it gives access \nto preliminary administrative examination \nof applications for future authorisations. \nAt the same time, the Honorary Pre-\nfect, Jean-Pierre Duport, has been \nholding discussions at the request of \nthe Prime Minister on speeding up \npublic-sector and private-sector pro-\njects relating to housing, urban devel-\nopment and spatial planning. \nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \ncalls for: \n – Empowering the Government to issue \norders to implement the recommen-\ndations of the task force for speeding \nup projects led by Jean-Pierre Duport \nand the work on modernising environ-\nmental law overseen by the Minister \nof Ecology, Sustainable Development \nand Energy. In addition to speeding \nup construction projects, the goal of \nthe bill is to clarify and streamline the \nenvironmental assessment process and \nto continue reforming public partici-\npation in the process, in keeping with \nthe principle of non-deterioration of \nacquired rights.\n – Extending the use of the single author-\nisation for installations classified for \nenvironmental protection purposes to \n\n36\nthe entire country for projects of major \neconomic importance, extending the \nuse of the project certificate to the \nGreater Paris Region for projects of \nmajor economic importance and, fol-\nlowing these preliminary extensions, \nintroducing a single environmental \npermit\nGOALS\n – Meeting the goal of issuing building \npermits within five months set by Pres-\nident Hollande\n – Supporting the construction industry, \nwhich has been particularly hard hit by \nthe crisis\n – Speeding up and securing major \ngrowth-boosting projects, such as the \nGrand Paris project\n\n37\nDeveloping employee share ownership  \nand fostering an entrepreneurial culture\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill includes reforms of two employee share \nownership schemes. The reforms are aimed at attracting and retaining businesses \nand talent in France by giving employees a bigger stake in the companies that em-\nploy them. \nSTATE OF PLAY \nEmployee share ownership is a means of \ncompensating employees for the risks \ntaken by their companies. It reinforces \nemployees’ involvement in their employ-\ners’ business by giving them a stake in \nthe company’s equity. \nThe founders’ share warrants introduced \nby the Jospin administration enable \nyoung companies to give their employ-\nees the option to buy shares in their com-\npany, while distributions of free shares \ngive employees an equity stake in their \ncompany. \nThe purpose of the reforms is to encour-\nage companies to give more of their \nemployees a stake in the company, \nextending ownership beyond the most \nsenior \nlevels \nof \nmanagement. \nThe \nreforms should also make France more \nattractive for the most mobile interna-\ntional executives.\nFRENCH IT START-UPS\nIT start-ups are high-growth companies, with average revenue increases of \n43% per year, and average international revenue growth of 100% per year. \nStart-ups’ labour force: 22% growth per year and 91% of employees hired \nunder permanent contracts. \nEmployee share ownership: 30% of employees own shares and 90% of start-\nups offer shares to employees, which means that 46% of the equity in start-\nups is owned by their executives and employees. \nAn engineer or developer earns on average two times less in France than in Si-\nlicon Valley. \nSenior executives earn on average 2 times more than their employees. \n\n38\nFounders’ share warrants are an instru-\nment for employee share ownership \nthat is specific to start-ups in the first \ntwo years of their lives. It is a very \nattractive tax incentive for employee \nshare ownership that targets start-ups’ \nequity warrants. The incentive is availa-\nble to listed and unlisted companies that \nare less than 15 years old, if they are val-\nued at less than 150 million euros and \nat least 25% of their equity is owned by \nindividuals. \nThis incentive is attractive, but its effec-\ntiveness has been hampered because \nit is ill suited to the start-up life cycle. \nA start-up that owns a subsidiary cannot \ngive the subsidiary’s employees found-\ners’ share warrants. This creates inequal-\nity between the subsidiary’s employees \nand those of the parent company. On the \nother hand, when a start-up is created \nthrough the merger of two start-ups that \nare eligible for the incentive, the new \nentity is not eligible. \nAnd yet, consolidation of start-ups \nthrough mergers and acquisitions is \ncritical for the creation of new industry \nchampions to drive growth and jobs. \nTherefore, the founders’ share warrants \nscheme had to be reviewed to fit the \nreal-world situation of start-ups and to \nhelp build industry champions. \nThere are not enough free distributions \nof shares. The Government’s objective \nis to increase free distributions of shares \nin large companies, as well as in inno-\nvative and conventional SMEs, and to \nextend them to all employees. The way \nfree distributions of shares work now \nundermines France’s attractiveness, par-\nticularly for high-potential executives and \nfor locating corporate headquarters in \nFrance.   \nTHEREFORE, THE BILL HAS TWO \nOBJECTIVES: \n – Encouraging companies to imple-\nment employee share ownership pol-\nicies for all employees and not just \nsenior executives. Such distributions \nwill be exempt from employers’ social \ncontributions in the case of SMEs that \nhave never paid dividends; \n – Reviewing the taxation of free dis-\ntributions of shares to bring it into \nline with the rest of the French tax \nsystem. \nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \nwill make employee share ownership \nmore attractive for both employees and \nemployers. \nThe Bill calls for start-ups to be able to \nattribute founders’ share warrants to all \nof their employees, including those work-\ning in subsidiaries. The Bill also calls for \nstart-ups created through mergers of \nother start-ups to remain eligible for this \nscheme. \nThe Bill aims to simplify taxation of free \ndistributions of shares and to unify the \ntax rules on capital gains, which means \nadapting the social security contribution \nrules for employees. The changes to the \nrules on employers’ social contributions \non free distributions of shares will bring \nthem into line with the rules for social \n\n39\nBefore\nAfter\nEmployees’ \ntaxes\nCapital gains subject to income \ntax, with two separate categories \n(wages/capital gains on sales of \nsecurities)\nCapital gains on free distributions \nof shares will be subject to the \nsame tax rules as capital gains on \nsecurities\nSocial  \ncontributions\nFor employees\nFor employers\nFor employees\nFor employers\nSpecial \nemployee’s \ncontribution \nof 10% due \nwhen shares are \nacquired and col-\nlected when they \nare sold.

Furthermore, the total savings of 100 bil-\nlion euros held by such schemes is not used adequately to finance the real economy. \nSTATE OF PLAY\nCompany savings schemes allow employ-\nees to have a stake in the growth of their \ncompany and earn extra income, which \nis to be used primarily for savings and \nnot for immediate consumption. The \nschemes \nmay \ninvolve \nprofit-sharing, \nshare ownership or savings plans (com-\npany savings plans, intercompany savings \nplans, retirement savings plans). \nSome of these schemes are hard for \nemployees and employers to under-\nstand. There is a lack of harmonisation, \nwhich gives rise to inequality between \nemployees, since such schemes are very \nrare in smaller companies. \nNot enough of these savings is used \nto finance the real economy, which is a \nkey priority in the Government’s policy to \nreform financing of the economy. \nAfter the steering body for com-\npany savings schemes and employee \nshare ownership (COPIESAS) submit-\nted its report to the Government on \n26 November 2014, management and \nlabour representatives met to discuss \nthe findings. \nMEASURES\nDEVELOPMENT OF COMPANY SAVINGS PLANS HAS VARIED  \nDEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF COMPANIES\nIn companies with more than 50 employees, 83% of the employees have ac-\ncess to at least one form of company savings scheme. This figure drops to 20% \nin companies with 10 to 49 employees and to 12% in companies with fewer \nthan 10 employees. \n\n42\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill is \nintended to be the practical implemen-\ntation of the company savings scheme \nreform that the President of the Repub-\nlic announced at the Social Conference \nin July 2014. For this purpose, the Bill \nis based on the findings of the steering \nbody for company savings schemes and \nemployee share ownership (COPIESAS), \nwhich submitted its report to the Govern-\nment on 26 November 2014. \nThe measures include: \n – Simplifying, harmonising and expand-\ning \naccess \nto \ncompany \nsavings \nschemes, particularly for people work-\ning in companies with fewer than 50 \nemployees, but without undoing any \nof the specific features of the individ-\nual schemes\n – Putting the more than 100 billion euros \nalready held in such savings schemes \ntoday to work for the real economy. \nThe Bill presented to the French cabinet \ncontains some preliminary measures to \nsimplify company savings schemes. \nThey include alignment of some of the \ntechnical procedures relating to prof-\nit-sharing and employee share ownership:\n – The timing of profit-sharing and share \nownership payments will be aligned\n – Setting up a company retirement sav-\nings scheme will now be possible \nwith the approval of two thirds of the \nemployees in companies with no union \nrepresentatives or works committees. \nAt present, only ordinary company sav-\nings schemes can be set up with the \napproval of two thirds of the employ-\nees in such companies. \n – The procedures for tacit renewal of \nprofit-sharing \nagreements \nwill \nbe \nsimplified. \nIn addition to these preliminary meas-\nures, the parliamentary debate on the \nGrowth and Economic Activity Bill will \nresult in further measures based on the \nfindings of the COPIESAS report and \nthe discussions now underway between \nmanagement and labour representa-\ntives. As the Prime Minister announced \nat the Social Conference in July 2014, \na cut in social security contributions to \nencourage the expansion of company \nsavings schemes in smaller companies \nand the use of such savings to finance \nthe real economy is now under con-\nsideration and should be included in \nthe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \nwhen it is debated by Parliament. \nGOALS\n – Expanding company savings schemes, \nespecially for employees of smaller \ncompanies who currently have little \nstake in the growth and success of \ntheir companies\n – Putting the large amounts of such sav-\nings to work for the real economy \n\n43\nImproving management of government \nholdings\nEnabling the government to finance its priorities through active management of its \nholdings, which means through the sale of such holdings \nSTATE OF PLAY\nThe government provides a great deal \nof \nfinancing \nfor \nFrench \ncompanies \nthrough its equity holdings in 74 compa-\nnies in such varied sectors as aerospace, \ndefence, transport, services and broad-\ncasting. Its equity portfolio is valued at \nsome 110 billion euros. \nThe \ngovernment’s \nequity \nportfolio \nshould be put to work to boost growth \nand economic activity. For this purpose, \nthe government should be able to sell \noff some of its holdings to free up capital \nthat can be used to pay down debt and \ninvest in new growth sectors. \nThis is the purpose of the active man-\nagement policy for government holdings \nannounced during the cabinet meeting \non 2 August 2013. Putting government \ncapital to work for French companies \nis a rightful use of such resources and \nan economic policy instrument that the \ngovernment intends to apply. \nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \ncontains measures concerning the use \nof the government’s holdings. There are \nthree series of measures. \nSupporting the industrial development \nof public-sector firms \nThe Bill contains provisions for support-\ning the industrial development of certain \npublic-sector firms. \nMore specifically, it authorises the Gov-\nernment to implement the planned \nbusiness alliance between the French \ngovernment-owned firm Nexter and \nthe German company KMW. This plan \nwas announced on 1 July 2014. It will \ncreate a European leader for land-based \nweapon systems, that combines the com-\nplementary expertise and know-how of \nthe two companies and gives them the \ncritical mass to ensure the growth of their \nexports. The transaction will create a \ndynamic that aims to reproduce the suc-\ncess that the Airbus Group has achieved \nin the aerospace sector in the land-based \nsector. \nOPENING UP THE CAPITAL OF CERTAIN \nGOVERNMENT-OWNED COMPANIES \nBy selling equity in certain companies, \nthe government will free up resources \nfor paying down debt and investing in \nnew growth sectors, and also attract new \nshareholders with strategies to expand \nbusiness, investment and employment.  \n\n44\nWHICH COMPANIES ARE CONCERNED?\nThe authorisations to sell equity concern the Lyons and Nice-Côte d’Azur Air-\nports. These authorisations enable the Government to sell shares in these com-\npanies, when the time comes, in conjunction and in consultation with the local \nauthorities concerned. \nCLARIFICATION OF THE GOVERNMENT  \nHOLDING REQUIREMENTS FOR GDF-SUEZ\nThe Act of 29 March 2014 on reconquering the real economy authorised the go-\nvernment to reduce its holding in GDF-Suez below the threshold of one third \nof the voting rights in view of the possibility of acquiring double voting rights. \nThese provisions will be supplemented to ensure their full implementation. \nMODERNISING AND SIMPLIFYING THE \nRULES FOR GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION \nThe Order of 20 August 2014 on the \ngovernance and corporate financing of \ngovernment-owned companies will be \nratified and supplemented with some \nmeasures to modernise and simplify the \nrules on government equity holdings. \nMore \nspecifically, \ngovernment-owned \ncompanies in which the government \ndecides to sell its shares on the financial \nmarket will be required to put a resolu-\ntion to the general meeting of sharehold-\ners on making an offer of shares reserved \nfor employees in order to promote \nemployee share ownership.\nGOALS\n – Modernising management of govern-\nment holdings to implement the new \npolicy on government share ownership\n – Enabling the government to sell some \nof its holdings to pay down its debt \nand finance its priorities, such as \ninvestment in strategic companies (as \nit did for PSA Peugeot-Citroën and \nAlstom)\n\n45\nWORK\n\n\n47\nEasing restrictions on Sunday and evening work\nReconciling economic efficiency and social justice by allowing retailers to open on \nSundays in places in which this stimulates economic activity, whilst at the same time \nmaking the system fairer by requiring all companies, irrespective of their size, to \ncompensate their employees who work on Sundays adequately for that work. Until \nnow, no such requirement existed in more than 600 tourist areas open on Sundays.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nShops which open for business on Sun-\ndays are currently the exception to the \nrule. There are three types of excep-\ntion: permanent sector-specific excep-\ntions, exceptions subject to municipal \nor prefectoral authorisation and regional \nexceptions.\nPermanent sector-specific exceptions: \nthese cover the retail food trade, with \nstores permitted to open on Sunday \nmornings until 1pm. They also include \nbusinesses important to daily life or that \nmeet the demands of industrial pro-\nduction: hotels, cafés and restaurants, \nflorists, home furnishing stores, the \nentertainment industry, public services, \nand energy and industrial services pro-\nvided around the clock.\nExceptions subject to municipal author-\nisation: these exceptions are known as \n‘dimanches du maire’ and are granted \nat the discretion of the local mayor, by \nmunicipal order or – in the case of Paris – \nby order of the Prefect, for a maximum of \nfive Sundays each year.\nTourist areas and Special Consumer \nZones (PUCEs): there are 640 tourist \nareas and 31 PUCEs in France. In the \ntourist areas, companies may employ \ntheir staff on Sundays during peak peri-\nods. Employers may require their staff \nto work on Sundays and no provision is \nmade for increased pay. Airports are also \nopen. In PUCEs, employees must volun-\nteer to work on Sundays. They receive \ndouble pay and are entitled to an equiv-\nalent amount of leave, except where a \ncollective agreement provides for alter-\nnative entitlements.\nCONSEQUENCES\nThe current system causes a loss of \nbusiness activity that is harmful to the \neconomy and creates a serious dispar-\nity between employees who earn extra \ncompensation and those who do not.\nA net loss of economic activity in cer-\ntain areas (with many tourists opting to \nspend the weekend in London rather \nthan in Paris, for example) and, in addi-\ntion, competition from online retailers \nwho are open all the time (for instance, \nAmazon generates 25% of its turnover \non Sundays).\nThere is inequality between areas in \nwhich \nadequate \ncompensation \nfor \nSunday work is a requirement (PUCEs, \nfor example) and those in which it is \noptional (tourist areas).\nThe system is ill-defined and extremely \ncomplex. Legislation currently in force \nhas increased the number of exceptions \nand types of area (retail or tourist), thus \ntriggering:\nProblems of competition between those \nbusinesses permitted to open and those \nthat are not (due to the sector in which \nthey operate or geographical boundaries)\nDifficulties in monitoring trading\nUncertain legal arrangements due to a \nlack of clear and coherent legislation and \ndifferent regional rules from one area to \nthe next (for example, the whole of Bor-\ndeaux is a tourist area but in Paris only a \nfew streets are).\n\n48\nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill is \nlargely based on the Bailly report, which \nwas presented to the Government in \nAugust 2013.\nSunday trading will remain the excep-\ntion, but restrictions will be eased by:\nAllowing mayors to authorise retailers \nin their municipalities to open on twelve \nSundays a year rather than the current \nfive\nGuaranteeing that each retailer will be \npermitted by law to trade on five of those \nSundays, to be chosen by the mayor\nCreating international tourist areas in \nwhich Sunday and evening trading will \nbe possible throughout the year in those \nplaces in which this may be justified on \nthe basis of specific criteria. This will \nextend to areas that attract high numbers \nof tourists and railway stations for which \nSunday and evening work will mean the \ncreation of thousands of additional jobs.\nSunday working will be made fairer:\n – From now on, all employees working \non Sundays shall receive adequate \ncompensation for that work, irrespec-\ntive of the size of the company. Until \nnow, no such requirement existed for \nFrance’s 600 tourist areas.\n – No person shall be required to work \non Sundays against his or her will, \nbecause the voluntary nature of such \nwork will be a prerequisite for the \nretailer to open. If there is no agree-\nment (at sector, region or company \nlevel) on the voluntary nature of such \nwork or on the level of adequate com-\npensation paid to employees, the \nstore will remain closed.\n – All retailers already permitted to open \nunder the current scheme will have \nthree years from the effective date of \nthe new legislation in which to negoti-\nate agreements with their employees if \nsuch agreements do not already exist.\nGOALS\nStimulate economic activity. Thanks \nto the new life that it will breathe into \nthe locations concerned, the opening of \nshops on Sundays, and in the evenings in \nthe international tourist areas, will stimu-\nlate economic activity through an increase \nin consumer spending and incidental \nexpenditure (dining, entertainment).\nEliminate inequality between Sunday \nworkers. All workers in the areas in ques-\ntion, including tourist areas, will be enti-\ntled to adequate compensation, to be \nnegotiated between employers and their \nemployees.\nFacilitate daily life. To allow those who \ndo not have the time to do their shop-\nping during the week to do it at the \nweekend, whilst still respecting the prin-\nciple of a rest day that is conducive to \nfamily and social life.\nSupport the tourism industry, an asset \nfor French competitiveness. Tourism is \na major industry in the French economy. \nWe must allow shops to open on Sun-\ndays in tourist areas to enhance France’s \nappeal.\n\n49\nReforming the labour court system\nThe industrial tribunal system is a burden for far too many employees and mana-\ngers of SMEs, and must be made more efficient, simpler, easier to understand and \nmore effective.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nIndustrial disputes are not being set-\ntled quickly enough:\n – The average time taken by an indus-\ntrial tribunal to deal with a dispute is \nincreasing year on year (6.3 months \nlonger than 13 years ago) and is cur-\nrently more than 15 months. It can \neven take as long as 29 months if \nthe case is referred to a professional \njudge.\n – The appeal process takes on average \n16 months\nThe current procedure is unsatisfactory \nin qualitative terms:\n – The average rate of conciliation is just \n6%\n – 20% of cases are ruled on by a profes-\nsional judge (32% in Paris and 25% in \nBordeaux)\n – The average appeal rate of cases is \n65%\n – Rulings \nare \nreversed \nin \n71% \nof \nappealed cases (in 30% of those cases, \nthe ruling is reversed in its entirety)\nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \nwill reform the industrial tribunal sys-\ntem, making it simpler, more efficient, \nmore transparent and more effective.\nThe industrial tribunal system will be \nimproved by providing better initial and \nongoing training to officials working \nwithin the system; such training will be \nmandatory. In addition, the obligations of \nprofessional conduct imposed on officials \nwill be more stringent and there will be \na major overhaul of the disciplinary pro-\ncedure. These measures will lend greater \nauthority to the rulings given.\nThe deadlines for the settlement of dis-\nputes will be significantly reduced and \nmade subject to limits from as early as \nthe conciliation phase – a smaller adju-\ndication panel must rule within three \nmonths. Furthermore, it will be possible \nto speed up the procedure considerably \nby passing from the conciliation stage \ndirectly to a hearing by a professional \njudge.\nDisputes will be joined when it is in the \ninterest of the proper administration of \njustice for proceedings pending before \nseveral industrial tribunals falling within \nthe jurisdiction of the same court of \nappeal to be decided jointly.\n\n50\nGOALS\n – To ensure that rulings are given much \nmore efficiently\n – To improve the quality of the rulings \ngiven through better training and by \napplying a more stringent code of con-\nduct applicable to officials working \nwithin the industrial tribunal system\n – To improve the representation of \nemployees and employers in proceed-\nings before industrial tribunals.\n\n51\nProviding greater protection  \nfor insolvency proceedings\nDoing everything possible to enable companies experiencing financial difficulties to \ncontinue to do business with a view to protecting as many jobs as possible. Streamli-\nning the commercial courts’ handling of cases involving the largest companies.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nAt present, the outcome of a good many \ncompulsory receivership proceedings is \nthat companies in financial difficulties \nare liquidated, stripped of their assets or \nforced to lay off their employees because \nthe shareholders are unable or unwill-\ning to provide the financing needed to \nsave the business, even when the com-\npany could have genuine prospects of \nrecovery.\nThe liquidation of the company is the \nworst scenario not only for the employ-\nees, the business and the means of pro-\nduction, but also for creditors, both \npublic and private, who lose their entire \ninvestment, and for employees lose their \njobs.\nOur current legislation enshrines the \nprinciple of shareholder primacy for the \npurpose of protecting ownership rights, \neven when such primacy leads to the \ndestruction of the company, jobs and \nother rights, such as creditors’ rights.\nFurthermore, troubled companies with \na number of subsidiaries would benefit \nfrom being dealt with jointly before the \nsame court, so that an overall solution \nmay be found which best protects the \nbusiness and jobs.\nMEASURES\nThe Growth and Economic Activity Bill \ngives the court the option, as a last \nresort, of requiring the people who con-\ntrol a company in financial difficulties to \nsell their shares to people putting for-\nward a viable plan to rescue the company \nand protect jobs. There will be more \nbalanced discussions between credi-\ntors, employees and shareholders. The \nrights of shareholders will be defended \nsubject to strict and specific conditions \nrelating to the financial difficulties of the \ncompany and will be placed under the \ncontrol of the court. In return, the new \nshareholders will have to draw up and \nfinance a plan that offers the company a \nnew opportunity to continue its business \nand protect as many jobs as possible.\nThe Bill also creates specialist commer-\ncial courts to deal with large compa-\nnies experiencing financial difficulties. \nThis gives French companies a better \nchance of survival and improves the \nprospects of protecting jobs. The com-\npanies concerned will be few in number, \nbut will include SMEs and large mid-tier \ncompanies.\n\n52\nGOALS\n – Provide greater opportunities for a \ncompany to continue its business and \nretain its employees even if it is facing \nfinancial difficulties\n – Improve the courts’ management of \ncases involving large companies in \nfinancial difficulties\n\n53\nReclassifying the offence of obstruction\nAs set out in the speech made by President Hollande to the Strategic Attractiveness \nCouncil on 19 October 2014, the criminal penalties attached to the offence of obs-\ntruction of the functioning of the bodies representing employees’ interests will be \nreplaced by financial penalties.\nSTATE OF PLAY\nIn the case of an employer, the offence of \nobstruction consists of undermining the \nexercise of trade union law, the desig-\nnation of bodies representing employ-\nees’ interests (staff representatives, trade \nunion representatives, representatives of \nthe trade union section, European Works \nCouncil, group-level works council, com-\npany-level works council, Health, Safety \nand Working Conditions Committee) or \nthe performance of the duties and role of \nemployee representatives.\nExamples:\n – Failing to provide access to infor-\nmation which must be supplied to \nemployee representatives by law\n – Failing to call employee representa-\ntives to meetings with due notice\nSize of penalty. The offence of obstruc-\ntion is currently punishable by one year’s \nimprisonment and a €3,750 fine.\nMEASURES\nThe penalties for the offence of obstruc-\ntion of the functioning of bodies rep-\nresenting employees’ interests will be \nreviewed to:\n – Remove the prison sentence for the \noffence of obstruction. This sentence \nis hardly ever applied, but may deter \nforeign investment\n – Replace it with financial penalties \nthat provide a sufficient deterrent\nGOALS\n – Improve France’s appeal\n – Modernise legislation\n\n\n\nPress contact\nTelephone: +33 1 53 18 45 13\nwww.economie.gouv.fr\nGraphic design : studio graphique, SIRCOM\n", "published_date": "2014-12-17", "section": "Dossiers"}
