Carrefour has \nbeen using blockchain since 2018 for the traceabi-\nlity of certain foodstuffs in the Carrefour 2022 \ntransformation plan.\n\n13\nInnovative framework \nfor blockchain in France\nThe French authorities have been working on blockchain technology \nand in particular its uses in the financial sector for several years \nnow. This commitment took shape in 2016 and continues today with the \ncreation of an innovative framework via the PACTE Action Plan for \nBusiness Growth and Transformation bill. This legislation offers \nparties involved in the blockchain segment a new ground-breaking \nlegal structure, with the aim of providing answers to the full \nrange of questions facing all stakeholders in this emerging eco- \nsystem – whether regulatory, tax or accounting – out to summer 2019.\nTechnology granted legal status in 2016\nFrance has built an ambitious and innovative framework that provides \nfor the use of blockchain technology in the financial sector, star-\nting in 2016, when legislation allowed for the application of this \ntechnology in crowdfunding. The 20161 order on interest-bearing \nnotes or bons de caisse provided for the use of blockchain for \nthe transfer of so-called minibon debt securities used in crowd- \nfunding.\nLater in 2017, a further order2 allowed the use of blockchain across \na much wider range of financial instruments, such as fund units, \nmarketable debt instruments, and unlisted shares and bonds, poten-\ntially involving assets worth as much as €2,000bn.\nThe PACTE Act lays out an innovative and ambitious \nframework for digital assets traded via blockchain \non both the primary and secondary markets\nOn the primary market, the PACTE Act sets out an individual framework \nfor initial coin offerings, or ICOs. France sees these initial coin \nofferings as a less costly alternative for SMEs to finance their \nbusinesses, and this fully warrants a balanced framework for this \nprocess, ensuring a secure legal structure for both issuers and \ninvestors.\n1. Order no. 2016-520 dated 28 April 2016\n2. Order no. 2017-1674 dated 8 December 2017\n\n14\nUnder Article 26 of the PACTE bill, issuers can request a visa from \nthe French financial markets regulator (Autorité des Marchés Finan-\nciers or AMF) before any coin offerings. Approval of this visa is \ndependent on compliance with the following rules:\n \n– the issuer is a legal entity established or registered in France;\n \n– funds collected during the ICO are monitored and safeguarded;\n \n– anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing obligations \nare fulfilled during the ICO.\nThis visa system will be optional, so issuers may conduct an ICO \nwithout requesting a visa in advance. However, any issuers who do \nopt for a visa will enjoy enhanced visibility as ICOs conducted \nby issuers with a visa feature on an AMF white list, while these \nissuers will also find it much easier to interact with traditional \nmarket participants, e.g. opening an account with a bank. This \nflexible regulation is in proportion to requirements and will not \ndiscourage SMEs from conducting ICOs.\nA legal framework is set up for various service providers.\nFrance transposes into national law the obligations outlined in \nthe European Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial \nsystem for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing3. \nThe government has also developed an optional accreditation sys-\ntem for all providers of services on digital assets. This optional \nset-up provides a set of rules specific to the various digital asset \nservice businesses.\nSupervision and provision of the accreditation will be managed by a \none-stop shop system set up by the AMF, with support from the French \nbanking and insurance supervisor Autorité de contrôle prudentiel \net de résolution (ACPR) on the issue of anti-money laundering and \ncounter terrorist financing. The AMF will draft a white list of \nlegitimate value-creating initiatives. \nThe PACTE bill also requires non-discriminatory access to credit \ninstitution services for approved service providers and authorised \nissues. It also allows professional funds – professional specia-\nlised investment funds and professional private equity funds – to \ninvest in digital assets.\nThe Act also includes steps to protect investors, with a ban on \nthe use of banners for marketing purposes for non-approved service \nproviders and initial coin offerings not accredited by the AMF. \nFrench tax legislation was modernised to take on board the challen-\nges raised by digital assets \nThe 2019 budget act provided important clarification leading to a \nclear tax framework for individuals who invest on an occasional \nbasis.\nTrading of digital assets does not lead to taxation per se: these \ntransactions are deemed to be neutral for such times as the digital \nassets involved are not converted into legal tender currency, or \nused to acquire goods or services. In the event of conversion or \nuse, capital gains are taxed at a rate of 30% i.e. 12.8% in income \ntax and 17.2% in social levies. \n3. Directive (EU) 2015/849 (revised in 2018)\n\n15\nThe applicable VAT system depends on whether consideration is pro-\nvided in return and what the nature of this consideration is i.e. \ndelivery of goods or provision of services. Cryptocurrency trade is \ndeemed equivalent to a financial transaction exempt from VAT.\nLastly, professionals will benefit from the considerable planned \nreduction in corporation tax, with the rate slated at 25% for 2022.\nFrench tax legislation was modernised to take \non board the challenges raised by digital assets \nThe 2019 budget act provided important clarification leading to a \nclear tax framework for individuals who invest on an occasional \nbasis.\nTrading of digital assets does not lead to taxation per se: these \ntransactions are deemed to be neutral for such times as the digital \nassets involved are not converted into legal tender currency, or \nused to acquire goods or services.

In February and March 2019, written contri-\nbutions were solicited, resulting in an inventory of more than 200 \nuse cases.\nFollowing this consultation work, the government plans to launch \na new phase aimed at driving further technological development, \nfostering ownership of blockchain technology by all segments of \nthe economy, and strengthening neutrality and security guarantees \nrelated to blockchain use. \nTrack 1: Strengthen the excellence and structuring \nof the French industrial sectors in order \nto initiate ambitious projects based on \ndistributed ledger technologies (by end 2019)\nAware of the potential that blockchain technology represents to \nthem, major groups are actively running pilot tests in their compa-\nnies in France and worldwide. \nThe National Industry Board (CNI) has been solidly structuring the \nindustrial ecosystem since 2013. The Strategic Sector Committees \n(CSFs), which work with French manufacturers on ambitious sector \nprojects, are a particularly strong driving force for French indus-\ntry to speed up the blockchain project transition. \nAgainst this backdrop, three major industrial sectors have already \ncommitted to working together on innovative solutions involving \nblockchain:\n \n– Construction industries: A platform of construction professionals \nworking on energy-smart housing retrofits will use the blockchain \ntechnology to secure the steps in the retrofit chain.\n\n17\n \n– Food industries: With the National Association of Food Industries \n(ANIA) and Coop de France at the helm, a working group will identify \nthe most promising use cases (e.g. enhancing sector transparency \nand product traceability). This working group may also focus \non the obstacles to the deployment of blockchain technology by \nproducers and processors.\n \n– The new energy services industry: This sector will implement \nthe Solar Solidarity Initiative, which harnesses blockchain \nto issue and secure solar energy generation certificates. These \ncertificates will be auctioned to fund the fitting and management of \nphotovoltaic installations by social landlords in their housing \nestates. The power and profits generated by these installations \nwill be passed on to the tenants.\nThe initiatives spearheaded by these sectors could receive funding \nfrom the Invest for the Future Programme’s (PIA) “Sector Support \nand Transformation” call for projects, open until the end of 2019.\nTrack 2: Foster innovative projects based on \ndistributed ledger technologies \nThe government will invest a total of €4.5 billion in all the \nmeasures to finance disruptive innovation in the next five years, \nnotably via its Deep Tech Plan, for which blockchain projects are \neligible. \nThe “Innovation – Growth Competition” call for projects funded by \nthe Invest for the Future Programme (PIA), open until 14 May, will \nfinance innovative projects with strong potential for the French \neconomy. Blockchain has been identified as one of the key disruptive \ntechnologies for this wave of the competition, in particular its \nDigital Deep Tech track. The purpose of this call for projects is to \nfund near-market projects presenting a disruptive innovation for a \nbudget of €600,000 to €5 million4.\n4. For details on the call for projects, see: https://www.bpifrance.fr/A-la-une/Appels-a-projets-concours/ \nAppel-a-projets-Concours-d-innovation-Croissance-38041\n\n18\nThe Deep Tech Plan\nBlockchain technology projects are eligible for funding under \nseveral components of the government-funded Deep Tech Plan:\n \n– The French Tech Seed fund, designed to support seed-phase Deep \nTech projects by covering development costs for disruptive \ntechnological innovations. This fund will support over 1,500 \ninnovative start-ups by 2023\n \n– The Fund for Innovation and Industry (FII), which takes three \nforms: \n• Setting up Deep Tech French Tech Emergence grants to support \npreliminary project study and feasibility phases for a maxi-\nmum sum of €90,000\n•  Scaling up the i-LAB Innovation Contest, which offers \nfinancial assistance for innovative technology start-ups\n• Stepping up individual grants for Deep Tech businesses. \nThese grants finance projects in R&D, scale-up and pre-pro-\nduction phases to promote market access for deep tech firms.\n\n19\nTrack 3: Be on the cutting edge \nin tackling the major technological challenges \n(by October 2019)\nTo be a leader in solving blockchain-related technical and tech-\nnology challenges, it is crucial to identify the key scientific and \ntechnical building blocks and hurdles for ramping up performance, \nsecurity and sustainability.\nA task force will be set up soon to identify ways to improve \nthe consensus methods, to underpin governance and sovereignty \nin the blockchain world, and to guarantee interoperability and \naccessibility in blockchain use. \nTrack 4: Assist blockchain project initiators \nwith their questions, especially legal \nand regulatory issues (by April 2019)\nFrance has developed a secure legal framework for ecosystem players \nwith the Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation (PACTE) \nbill and the 2019 Budget Act. In the other areas of application, \nFrance Expérimentation will provide blockchain project initia-\ntors with solid priority assistance for the legal challenges they \nencounter so that they can legally secure their innovative pro-\njects.\nIn addition, free workshops will be held at French Tech Central in \nStation F to facilitate exchanges between the relevant government \ndepartments and the ecosystem’s start-ups and businesses.\n\n20\nUses for blockchain \ntechnology in the financing \nsector\nSome of blockchain’s primary uses are in the financial sector, as \nblockchain and other distributed ledger technologies irrevocably \nguarantee ownership and peer-to-peer transfer of valuable digital \nassets using a consensus protocol or algorithm.  \nThe technology provides a system to manage transactions both secu-\nrely and seamlessly between several market participants and also \nallows issues to be conducted for investors in a secure environment \nvia ICO, STO, IEO, etc. \nTrading platforms have developed gradually, enabling users to \ntrade digital assets for other digital assets, and sometimes for \nfiat currencies.\nBlockchain technology also ensures increased security and transpa-\nrency in transaction ledgers, without the need for a central custo-\ndian or certain intermediaries to record changes in ownership.\nSome French companies that use blockchain \nfor financial purposes\nAPPI is a RegTech that offers an electronic multi-currency wallet \non a B2B2C basis (fiat currency or cryptocurrency), along with a KYC \nservice to manage client identities. \nBlockchain ARK also stands out from the crowd with its SmartBridge \nconcept, enabling it to connect to other blockchains and take ad-\nvantage of their specific features. The company has its own cryp-\ntocurrency, Ark, which is one of the 50 leading cryptocurrencies \nworldwide. \nBELEM offers a blockchain platform that facilitates secure trading \nand digital data traceability as well as digitisation of financial \nassets. \nBlockpulse has developed a product to help start-ups simplify \nmanagement of their first fund-raising process. \nBig Block is a blockchain calculation expert and mining farm \nmanager. \n\n21\nThe Bitit platform stands out via its diverse range of payment me-\nthods that the buyer can use i.e. card payment, bank transfer, vou-\nchers, etc.\nBlockchain Partner was created in 2017 from the merger of two \nstart-ups set up in 2015 i.e. Blockchain France, which focuses on \ntraining and consulting, and Labo Blockchain, which specialises in \nR&D and technical development.\nCoinhouse formerly la Maison du Bitcoin) was set up in 2014, and is \na pioneering digital asset investment company, with an online plat-\nform and a physical store.\nCoinStruction Network is a market-making service that provides \nliquidity on recently-listed tokens on the secondary market (cen-\ntralised/decentralised exchanges). \nLe Crédit Agricole announced that it would soon be launching a \nprogramme aimed at facilitating the transfer of funds for cross-border \ntransactions using Ripple-developed blockchain, which cuts trans-\nfer time from three days to just a few minutes.\nDether is an application that enables users to buy and sell ether \nvia their smartphone and even spend the cryptocurrency in stores.\nThe Electrum ewallet is accessible offline and via computer.

Transactions are grouped together in blocks. Users \n(“miners”) validate each block using specific techniques that vary \nby the type of blockchain.\nWhat are digital assets?\nDigital assets are binary assets exchanged on a blockchain. There \nare different categories of digital assets depending on the “rights” \nattached to them:\n \n– Cyptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin), which are representations of \nvalue and means of exchange transmitted on a blockchain;\n \n– Tokens that entail rights, such as a share in business capital or \na payment in advance for the service the business is developing. \nIssues of these tokens are known as STOs (Security Token Offerings) \nwhen the token has the characteristics of a financial security and \nICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) when the token does not have these \ncharacteristics.\nA conducts \na transaction \nto be sent to B\nThe block is validated by \nthe network nodes using crypto-\ngraphic techniques\nThe block is dated and added \nto the blockchain accessible \nby all users.\nB receives \nthe transaction \nfrom A\nA number of \ntransactions are \ngrouped into a block\n\n29\nWhat is an ICO?\nAn ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a fund-raising method that ope-\nrates by issuing tokens that can be exchanged for digital assets or \nlegal tender in a project start-up phase. These tokens can then be \nsold on a secondary market.\nICOs differ from classic fund-raising in that tokens are acquired, \nrather than a business’s financial securities (in which case the \nfund-raising on the blockchain is called a Security Token Offe-\nring – or STO5). These tokens can offer a right to use the service \ndeveloped or to be developed by the business. ICOs give start-ups \naccess to funding very quickly and reach a broad-based internatio-\nnal audience of potential investors.\nWhat is a smart contract?\nThe smart contract concept was established in the 1990s and repre-\nsents the digital equivalent of a traditional contract. Unlike the \ntraditional contract, performance of the smart contract requires \nno third party mediator: it is governed by a computer code that \nincludes the performance conditions. It uses the blockchain tech-\nnology to secure the terms of its performance. \nBlockchain’s potential\nThe decentralisation, security and transparency of blockchain have \nthe potential to support a large number of uses:\n \n– Transfers of assets (monetary, but also securities, votes, \nshares, etc.);\n \n– Product tracking and traceability;\n \n– Automatic execution of contractual conditions (smart contracts) \nwithout any human intervention.\nTheir scope is broad: banks, insurance, healthcare and supply \nchains, but also energy management, voting procedures and many \nothers.\n5. Security Token Offerings (STOs) are similar to ICOs, but differ in that the token issued represents \na share of the business’s capital. From this point of view, STOs are closer to « classic » fund-raising.\n\n\n\nPress contact:\nCabinet de Bruno Le Maire\npresse.mineco@cabinets.finances.gouv.fr\n01 53 18 41 13\n", "published_date": "2019-04-15", "section": "Dossiers"}
