The\nCommission’s aim has been to identify the limits of GDP as an indicator of economic\nperformance and social progress, including the problems with its measurement; to\nconsider what additional information might be required for the production of more\nrelevant indicators of social progress; to assess the feasibility of alternative measurement\ntools, and to discuss how to present the statistical information in an appropriate way.\n2)\nIn effect, statistical indicators are important for designing and assessing policies aiming\nat advancing the progress of society, as well as for assessing and influencing the\nfunctioning of economic markets. Their role has increased significantly over the last two\ndecades. This reflects improvements in the level of education in the population, increases\nin the complexity of modern economies and the widespread use of information\ntechnology. In the “information society”, access to data, including statistical data, is\nmuch easier. More and more people look at statistics to be better informed or to make\ndecisions. To respond to the growing demand for information, the supply of statistics has\nalso increased considerably, covering new domains and phenomena.\n3)\nWhat we measure affects what we do; and if our measurements are flawed, decisions may\nbe distorted. Choices between promoting GDP and protecting the environment may be\nfalse choices, once environmental degradation is appropriately included in our\nmeasurement of economic performance. So too, we often draw inferences about what are\ngood policies by looking at what policies have promoted economic growth; but if our\nmetrics of performance are flawed, so too may be the inferences that we draw.  \n4)\nHowever, there often seems to be a marked distance between standard measures of\nimportant socio economic variables like economic growth, inflation, unemployment, etc.\nand widespread perceptions. The standard measures may suggest, for instance that there\nis less inflation or more growth than individuals perceive to be the case, and the gap is so\nlarge and so universal that it cannot be explained by reference to money illusion or to\nhuman psychology. In some countries, this gap has undermined confidence in official\nstatistics (for example, in France and in the United Kingdom. only one third of citizens\ntrust official figures, and these countries are not exceptions), with a clear impact on the\nway in which public discourse about the conditions of the economy and necessary\npolicies takes place.\n5)\nThere may be several explanations for the gap between the statistical measurement of\nsocio-economic phenomena and citizen perception of the same phenomena: \n\n8\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n– The statistical concepts may be correct, but the measurement process may be imperfect. \n– In many cases, there are debates about what are the right concepts, and the appropriate\nuse of different concepts.\n– When there are large changes in inequality (more generally a change in income distri-\nbution) gross domestic product (GDP) or any other aggregate computed per capita may\nnot provide an accurate assessment of the situation in which most people find themsel-\nves. If inequality increases enough relative to the increase in average per capital GDP,\nmost people can be worse off even though average income is increasing\n– The commonly used statistics may not be capturing some phenomena, which have an\nincreasing impact on the well-being of citizens. For example, traffic jams may increase\nGDP as a result of the increased use of gasoline, but obviously not the quality of life.\nMoreover, if citizens are concerned about the quality of air, and air pollution is\nincreasing, then statistical measures which ignore air pollution will provide an inaccurate\nestimate of what is happening to citizens’ well-being. Or a tendency to measure gradual\nchange may be inadequate to capture risks of abrupt alterations in the environment such\nas climate change. \n– The way in which statistical figures are reported or used may provide a distorted view\nof the trends of economic phenomena. For example, much emphasis is usually put on\nGDP although net national product (which takes into account the effect of depreciation),\nor real household income (which focuses on the real income of households within the\neconomy) may be more relevant. These numbers may differ markedly. Then, GDP is not\nwrong as such, but wrongly used.  What is needed is a better understanding of the appro-\npriate use of each measure.\n6)\nIndeed, for a long time there have been concerns about the adequacy of current measures\nof economic performance, in particular those solely based on GDP. Besides, there are\neven broader concerns about the relevance of these figures as measures of societal well-\nbeing. To focus specifically on the enhancement of inanimate objects of convenience (for\nexample in the GNP or GDP which have been the focus of a myriad of economic studies\nof progress), could be ultimately justified – to the extent it could be – only through what\nthese objects do to the human lives they can directly or indirectly influence. Moreover, it\nhas long been clear that GDP is an inadequate metric to gauge well-being over time\nparticularly in its economic, environmental, and social dimensions, some aspects of\nwhich are often referred to as sustainability. \nWhy is this report important?\n7)\nBetween the time that the Commission began working on this report and the completion\nof this Report, the economic context has radically changed. We are now living one of the\nworst financial, economic and social crises in post-war history. The reforms in\nmeasurement recommended by the Commission would be highly desirable, even if we\nhad not had the crisis. But some members of the Commission believe that the crisis\nprovides heightened urgency to these reforms. They believe that one of the reasons why\nthe crisis took many by surprise is that our measurement system failed us and/or market\nparticipants and government officials were not focusing on the right set of statistical\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n9\nindicators. In their view, neither the private nor the public accounting systems were able\nto deliver an early warning, and did not alert us that the seemingly bright growth\nperformance of the world economy between 2004 and 2007 may have been achieved at\nthe expense of future growth. It is also clear that some of the performance was a\n“mirage”, profits that were based on prices that had been inflated by a bubble. It is\nperhaps going too far to hope that had we had a better measurement system, one that\nwould have signalled problems ahead, so governments might have taken early measures\nto avoid or at least to mitigate the present turmoil. But perhaps had there been more\nawareness of the limitations of standard metrics, like GDP, there would have been less\neuphoria over economic performance in the years prior to the crisis; metrics which\nincorporated assessments of sustainability (e.g. increasing indebtedness) would have\nprovided a more cautious view of economic performance. But many countries lack a\ntimely and complete set of wealth accounts – the ‘balance sheets’ of the economy – that\ncould give a comprehensive picture of assets, debts and liabilities of the main actors in\nthe economy.\n8)\nWe are also facing a looming environmental crisis, especially associated with global\nwarming. Market prices are distorted by the fact that there is no charge imposed on\ncarbon emissions; and no account is made of the cost of these emissions in standard\nnational income accounts. Clearly, measures of economic performance that reflected\nthese environmental costs might look markedly different from standard measures.\n9)\nIf the view expressed in the preceding paragraphs is not necessarily shared by all\nmembers of the Commission, the whole Commission is convinced that the crisis is\nteaching us a very important lesson: those attempting to guide the economy and our\nsocieties are like pilots trying to steering a course without a reliable compass. The\ndecisions they (and we as individual citizens) make depend on what we measure, how\ngood our measurements are and how well our measures are understood. We are almost\nblind when the metrics on which action is based are ill-designed or when they are not\nwell understood. For many purposes, we need better metrics. Fortunately, research in\nrecent years has enabled us to improve our metrics, and it is time to incorporate in our\nmeasurement systems some of these advances. There is also consensus among the\nCommission members that better measures may enable us to steer our economies better\nthrough and out of crises. Many of the indicators put forward by the report will lend\nthemselves to this purpose.\n10) The report is about measurement rather than policies, thus it does not discuss how best\nour societies could advance through collective actions in the pursuit of various goals.\nHowever, as what we measure shapes what we collectively strive to pursue – and what\nwe pursue determines what we measure - the report and its implementation may have a\nsignificant impact on the way in which our societies looks at themselves and, therefore,\non the way in which policies are designed, implemented and assessed.\n11) The Commission notes the important progress in statistical measurement that has\noccurred in recent years, and urges continued efforts to improve our statistical data base\nand the indicators that are constructed from this data base. The report indicates avenues\nfor more or different measurement efforts in various domains, and we hope that it will\ninfluence future statistical policies in both developed and developing countries, as well as\nthe work of international organisations that play a key role in the development of\nstatistical standards worldwide.  \n\n10\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBy whom has the report been written?\n12) This is a report written by economists and social scientists. The members of the\nCommission represent a broad range of specialisations, from national accounting to the\neconomics of climate change. The members have conducted research on social capital,\nhappiness, and health and mental well-being. They share the belief that it is important to\nbuild bridges between different communities – between the producers and users of\nstatistical information, whatever their discipline – that have become increasingly distant\nin recent years. Commission members see their expertise as a complement to reports on\nsimilar topics that were written from a different perspective, for instance by scientists on\nclimate change or by psychologists on mental health. Although the core of the report is\nrather technical, the summaries of the technical chapter have been written using, as much\nas possible, non-technical language.\nTo whom is the report addressed?\n13) The Commission hopes that the Report will find a receptive audience among four distinct\ngroups, and it has been written with that in mind. The Report is addressed, first of all, to\npolitical leaders. In this time of crises, when new political narratives are necessary to\nidentify where our societies should go, the report advocates a shift of emphasis from a\n“production-oriented” measurement system to one focused on the well-being of current\nand future generations, i.e. toward broader measures of social progress.  \n14) Second, the report is aimed at reaching policy-makers who wish to get a better sense of\nwhich indicators are available and useful to design, implement and assess policies aimed\nat improving well-being and foster social progress. Policy-makers are reminded both of\nthe richness and of the shortcomings of existing data but also of the fact that reliable\nquantitative information ‘does not grow on trees’ and significant investments need to be\nmade to develop statistics and indicators that provide policymakers with the information\nthey need to make the decisions confronting them. \n15) Third, the report has been written for the academic community, statisticians, and\nintensive users of statistics. They are reminded of how difficult it can be to produce\nreliable data and of the numerous assumptions that underlay all statistical series.\nAcademics will, hopefully, become more cautious in the confidence they place in certain\nstatistics. Those in national statistical offices will, hopefully find helpful suggestions\nabout areas where further developments might be particularly valuable. \n16) Lastly, the report has been written for civil society organisations that are both users and\nproducers of statistics. More generally, it is addressed to the public at large, whether from\nricher or poorer countries and whether rich or poor within societies. We hope that through\na better understanding of the statistical data and indicators that are available (their\nstrengths and limits), they can make a better assessment of the problems facing their\nsocieties. We hope the report will also serve journalists and the media who have a\nresponsibility in enabling citizens to get a sense of what is happening in the society in\nwhich they are living. Information is a public good; the more we are informed about what\nis happening in our society, the better will our democracies be able to function.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n11\n What are the main messages and recommendations?\n17) The report distinguishes between an assessment of current well-being and an assessment\nof sustainability, whether this can last over time. Current well-being has to do with both\neconomic resources, such as income, and with non-economic aspects of peoples’ life\n(what they do and what they can do, how they feel, and the natural environment they live\nin). Whether these levels of well-being can be sustained over time depends on whether\nstocks of capital that matter for our lives (natural, physical, human, social) are passed on\nto future generations. \nTo organise its work, the Commission organized itself into three working groups,\nfocusing respectively on: Classical GDP issues, Quality of life and Sustainability. The\nfollowing main messages and recommendations arise from the report\nTowards better measures of economic performance in a complex economy\n18) Before going beyond GDP and tackling the more difficult task of measuring well-being,\nit is worth asking where existing measures of economic performance need improving.\nMeasuring production – a variable which among other things determines the level of\nemployment – is essential for the monitoring of economic activity. The first main\nmessage of our report is that time has come to adapt our system of measurement of\neconomic activity to better reflect the structural changes which have characterized the\nevolution of modern economies. In effect, the growing share of services and the\nproduction of increasingly complex products make the measurement of output and\neconomic performance more difficult than in the past. There are now many products\nwhose quality is complex, multi-dimensional and subject to rapid change. This is obvious\nfor goods, like cars, computers, washing machines and the like, but is even truer for\nservices, such as medical services, educational services, information and communication\ntechnologies, research activities and financial services. In some countries and some\nsectors, increasing “output” is more a matter of an increase in the quality of goods\nproduced and consumed than in the quantity. Capturing quality change is a tremendous\nchallenge, yet this is vital to measuring real income and real consumption, some of the\nkey determinants of people’s material well-being. Under-estimating quality\nimprovements is equivalent to over-estimating the rate of inflation, and therefore to\nunder-estimating real income. The opposite is true when quality improvements are over-\nstated. \n19) Governments play an important part in today’s economies. They provide services of a\n“collective” nature, such as security, and of a more “individual” nature, such as medical\nservices and education. The mix between private and public provision of individual\nservices varies significantly across countries and over time. Beyond the contribution of\ncollective services to citizens’ living standards, individual services, particularly\neducation, medical services, public housing or public sports facilities, are almost\ncertainly valued positively by citizens. These services tend to be large in scale, and have\nincreased considerably since World War II, but, in many cases, they remain badly\nmeasured. Traditionally, measures have been based on the inputs used to produce these\nservices (such as the number of doctors) rather than on the actual outputs produced (such\nas the number of particular medical treatments). Making adjustments for quality changes\nis even more difficult. Because outputs are taken to move in tandem with inputs\n\n12\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nproductivity change in the provision of these services is ignored. It follows that if there is\npositive (negative) productivity change in the public sector, our measures under (over)-\nestimate economic growth and real income. For a satisfactory measure of economic\nperformance and living standards it is thus important to come to grips with measuring\ngovernment output. (In our present, admittedly flawed, system of measurement based on\nexpenditures, government output represents around 20% of GDP in many OECD\ncountries and total government expenditure more than 40% for the OECD countries.) \n20) While there are methodological disagreements about how to make the adjustments to\nquality or how to go about measuring government output, there is a broad consensus that\nadjustments should be made, and even about the principles which should guide such\nadjustments. The disagreements arise in the practical implementation of these principles.\nThe Commission has addressed both the principles and the difficulties in\nimplementations, in its Report.\nFrom production to well-being\n21) Another key message, and unifying theme of the report, is that the time is ripe for our\nmeasurement system to shift emphasis from measuring economic production to\nmeasuring people’s well-being. And measures of well-being should be put in a context of\nsustainability. Despite deficiencies in our measures of production, we know much more\nabout them than about well-being. Changing emphasis does not mean dismissing GDP\nand production measures. They emerged from concerns about market production and\nemployment; they continue to provide answers to many important questions such as\nmonitoring economic activity. But emphasising well-being is important because there\nappears to be an increasing gap between the information contained in aggregate GDP\ndata and what counts for common people’s well-being. This means working towards the\ndevelopment of a statistical system that complements measures of market activity by\nmeasures centred on people’s well-being and by measures that capture sustainability.\nSuch a system must, of necessity, be plural – because no single measure can summarize\nsomething as complex as the well-being of the members of society, our system of\nmeasurement must encompass a range of different measures. The issue of aggregation\nacross dimensions (that is to say, how we add up, for example, a measure of health with a\nmeasure of consumption of conventional goods), while important, is subordinate to the\nestablishment of  a broad statistical system that captures as many of the relevant\ndimensions as possible. Such a system should not just measure average levels of well-\nbeing within a given community, and how they change over time, but also document the\ndiversity of peoples’ experiences and the linkages across various dimensions of people’s\nlife. There are several dimensions to well-being but a good place to start is the\nmeasurement of material well-being or living standards.\nRecommendation 1: When evaluating material well-being, look at income and consumption \nrather than production\n22) GDP is the most widely-used measure of economic activity. There are international\nstandards for its calculation, and much thought has gone into its statistical and conceptual\nbases. Earlier paragraphs have emphasized some of the important areas where more\nprogress is needed in its computation. As statisticians and economists know very well,\nGDP mainly measures market production – expressed in money units – and as such it is\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n13\nuseful. However, it has often been treated as if it were a measure of economic well-being.\nConflating the two can lead to misleading indications about how well-off people are and\nentail the wrong policy decisions. Material living standards are more closely associated\nwith measures of net national income, real household income and consumption –\nproduction can expand while income decreases or vice versa when account is taken of\ndepreciation, income flows into and out of a country, and differences between the prices\nof output and the prices of consumer products.\nRecommendation 2: Emphasise the household perspective\n23) While it is informative to track the performance of economies as a whole, trends in\ncitizens’ material living standards are better followed through measures of household\nincome and consumption. Indeed, the available national accounts data shows that in a\nnumber of OECD countries real household income has grown quite differently from real\nGDP per capita, and typically at a lower rate. The household perspective entails taking\naccount of payments between sectors, such as taxes going to government, social benefits\ncoming from government, and interest payments on household loans going to financial\ncorporations. Properly defined, household income and consumption should also reflect\nin-kind services provided by government, such as subsidized health care and educational\nservices. A major effort of statistical reconciliation will also be required to understand\nwhy certain measures such as household income can move differently depending on the\nunderlying statistical source.\nRecommendation 3: Consider income and consumption jointly with wealth\n24) Income and consumption are crucial for assessing living standards, but in the end they\ncan only be gauged in conjunction with information on wealth. A household that spends\nits wealth on consumption goods increases its current well-being but at the expense of its\nfuture well-being. The consequences of such behavior would be captured in a\nhousehold’s balance sheet, and the same holds for other sectors of the economy, and for\nthe economy as a whole. To construct balance sheets, we need comprehensive accounts\nof assets and liabilities. Balance sheets for countries are not novel in concept, but their\navailability is still limited and their construction should be promoted. Measures of wealth\nare central to measuring sustainability. What is carried over into the future necessarily\nhas to be expressed as stocks – of physical, natural, human and social capital. The right\nvaluation of these stocks plays a crucial role, and is often problematic. There is also a\nneed to “stress test” balance sheets with alternative valuations when market prices for\nassets are not available or are subject to bubbles and bursts.  Some more direct non-\nmonetary indicators may be preferable when the monetary valuation is very uncertain or\ndifficult to derive.\nRecommendation 4: Give more prominence to the distribution of income, consumption \nand wealth\n25) Average income, consumption and wealth are meaningful statistics, but they do not tell\nthe whole story about living standards. For example, a rise in average income could be\nunequally shared across groups, leaving some households relatively worse-off than\nothers. Thus, average measures of income, consumption and wealth should be\naccompanied by indicators that reflect their distribution. Median consumption (income,\n\n14\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nwealth) provides a better measure of what is happening to the “typical” individual or\nhousehold than average consumption (income or wealth). But for many purposes, it is\nalso important to know what is happening at the bottom of the income/wealth distribution\n(captured in poverty statistics), or at the top. Ideally, such information should not come in\nisolation but be linked, i.e. one would like information about how well-off households are\nwith regard to different dimensions of material living standards: income, consumption\nand wealth. After all, a low-income household with above-average wealth is not\nnecessarily worse-off than a medium-income household with no wealth. (The desirability\nof providing information on the “joint distribution” of the dimensions of people’s well-\nbeing will be raised once again in the recommendations below on how to measure quality\nof life.)\nRecommendation 5: Broaden income measures to non-market activities\n26) There have been major changes in how households and society function. For example,\nmany of the services people received from other family members in the past are now\npurchased on the market. This shift translates into a rise in income as measured in the\nnational accounts and may give a false impression of a change in living standards, while\nit merely reflects a shift from non-market to market provision of services. Many services\nthat households produce for themselves are not recognized in official income and\nproduction measures, yet they constitute an important aspect of economic activity. While\ntheir exclusion from official measures reflects uncertainty about data more than\nconceptual difficulties, there has been progress in this arena; still, more and more\nsystematic work in this area should be undertaken. This should start with information on\nhow people spend their time that is comparable both over the years and across countries.\nComprehensive and periodic accounts of household activity as satellites to the core\nnational accounts should complement the picture. In developing countries, the production\nof goods (for instance food or shelter) by households plays an important role. Tracking\nthe production of such home-produced goods is important to assess consumption levels\nof households in these countries. \n27) Once one starts focusing on non-market activities, the question of leisure arises.\nConsuming the same bundle of goods and services but working for 1500 hours a year\ninstead of 2000 hours a year implies an increase in one’s standard of living. Although\nvaluation of leisure is fraught with difficulties, comparisons of living standards over time\nor across countries needs to take into account the amount of leisure that people enjoy.\nWell-being is multi-dimensional\n28) To define what well-being means a multidimensional definition has to be used. Based on\nacademic research and a number of concrete initiatives developed around the world, the\nCommission has identified the following key dimension that should be taken into\naccount. At least in principle, these dimensions should be considered simultaneously:\ni.\nMaterial living standards (income, consumption and wealth);\nii.\nHealth;\niii.\nEducation;\niv.\nPersonal activities including work\nv.\nPolitical voice and governance;\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n15\nvi.\nSocial connections and relationships;\nvii. Environment (present and future conditions);\nviii. Insecurity, of an economic as well as a physical nature.\nAll these dimensions shape people’s well-being, and yet many of them are missed by conven-\ntional income measures.\nObjective and subjective dimensions of well-being are both important\nRecommendation 6: Quality of life depends on people’s objective conditions and capabilities.\nSteps should be taken to improve measures of people’s health, education, personal activities\nand environmental conditions. In particular, substantial effort should be devoted to\ndeveloping and implementing robust, reliable measures of social connections, political voice,\nand insecurity that can be shown to predict life satisfaction.\n29) The information relevant to valuing quality of life goes beyond people’s self-reports and\nperceptions to include measures of their “functionings” and freedoms. In effect, what\nreally matters are the capabilities of people, that is, the extent of their opportunity set and\nof their freedom to choose among this set, the life they value. The choice of relevant\nfunctionings and capabilities for any quality of life measure is a value judgment, rather\nthan a technical exercise. But while the precise list of the features affecting quality of life\ninevitably rests on value judgments, there is a consensus that quality of life depends on\npeople’s health and education, their everyday activities (which include the right to a\ndecent job and housing), their participation in the political process, the social and natural\nenvironment in which they live, and the factors shaping their personal and economic\nsecurity. Measuring all these features requires both objective and subjective data. The\nchallenge in all these fields is to improve upon what has already been achieved, to\nidentify gaps in available information, and to invest in statistical capacity in areas (such\nas time-use) where available indicators remain deficient.\nRecommendation 7: Quality-of-life indicators in all the dimensions covered should assess \ninequalities in a comprehensive way\n30) Inequalities in human conditions are integral to any assessment of quality of life across\ncountries and the way that it is developing over time. Most dimensions of quality-of-life\nrequire appropriate separate measures of inequality, but, as noted in par. 25, taking into\naccount linkages and correlations. Inequalities in quality of life should be assessed across\npeople, socio-economic groups, gender and generations, with special attention to\ninequalities that have arisen more recently, such as those linked to immigration.\nRecommendation 8: Surveys should be designed to assess the links between various quality-\nof-life domains for each person, and this information should be used when designing policies \nin various fields\n31) It is critical to address questions about how developments in one domain of quality of life\naffect other domains, and how developments in all the various fields are related to\nincome. This is important because the consequences for quality of life of having multiple\ndisadvantages far exceed the sum of their individual effects. Developing measures of\n\n16\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nthese cumulative effects requires information on the “joint distribution” of the most\nsalient features of quality of life across everyone in a country through dedicated surveys.\nSteps in this direction could also be taken by including in all surveys some standard\nquestions that allow classifying respondents based on a limited set of characteristics.\nWhen designing policies in specific fields, impacts on indicators pertaining to different\nquality-of-life dimensions should be considered jointly, to address the interactions\nbetween dimensions and the needs of people who are disadvantaged in several domains\nRecommendation 9: Statistical offices should provide the information needed to aggregate \nacross quality-of-life dimensions, allowing the construction of different indexes.\n32) While assessing quality-of-life requires a plurality of indicators, there are strong\ndemands to develop a single summary measure. Several summary measures of quality of\nlife are possible, depending on the question addressed and the approach taken. Some of\nthese measures are already being used, such as average levels of life-satisfaction for a\ncountry as a whole, or composite indices that aggregate averages across objective\ndomains, such as the Human Development Index. Others could be implemented if\nnational statistical systems made the necessary investment to provide the data required\nfor their computation. These include measures of the proportion of one’s time in which\nthe strongest reported feeling is a negative one, measures based on counting the\noccurrence and severity of various objective features of people’s lives, and (equivalent-\nincome) measures based on people’s states and preferences.\n33) The Commission believes that in addition to objective indicators of well-being,\nsubjective measures of the quality-of-life should be considered. \nRecommendation 10: Measures of both objective and subjective well-being provide key\ninformation about people’s quality of life. Statistical offices should incorporate questions to\ncapture people’s life evaluations, hedonic experiences and priorities in their own survey.\n34) Research has shown that it is possible to collect meaningful and reliable data on\nsubjective as well as objective well-being. Subjective well-being encompasses different\naspects (cognitive evaluations of one’s life, happiness, satisfaction, positive emotions\nsuch as joy and pride, and negative emotions such as pain and worry): each of them\nshould be measured separately to derive a more comprehensive appreciation of people’s\nlives. Quantitative measures of these subjective aspects hold the promise of delivering\nnot just a good measure of quality of life per se, but also a better understanding of its\ndeterminants, reaching beyond people’s income and material conditions. Despite the\npersistence of many unresolved issues, these subjective measures provide important\ninformation about quality of life. Because of this, the types of question that have proved\ntheir value within small-scale and unofficial surveys should be included in larger-scale\nsurveys undertaken by official statistical offices. \nUse a pragmatic approach towards measuring sustainability \n35) Measuring and assessing sustainability has been a central concern of the Commission.\nSustainability poses the challenge of determining if at least the current level of well-\nbeing can be maintained for future generations. By its very nature, sustainability involves\nthe future and its assessment involves many assumptions and normative choices. This is\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n17\nfurther complicated by the fact that at least some aspects of environmental sustainability\n(notably climate change) is affected by interactions between the socio-economic and\nenvironmental models followed by different countries. The issue is indeed complex,\nmore complex than the already complicated issue of measuring current well-being or\nperformance. \nRecommendation 11: Sustainability assessment requires a well-identified dashboard of\nindicators. The distinctive feature of the components of this dashboard should be that they are\ninterpretable as variations of some underlying “stocks”. A monetary index of sustainability\nhas its place in such a dashboard but, under the current state of the art, it should remain\nessentially focused on economic aspects of sustainability.\n36) The assessment of sustainability is complementary to the question of current well-being\nor economic performance, and must be examined separately. This may sound trivial and\nyet it deserves emphasis, because some existing approaches fail to adopt this principle,\nleading to potentially confusing messages. For instance, confusion may arise when one\ntries to combine current well-being and sustainability into a single indicator. To take an\nanalogy, when driving a car, a meter that added up in one single number the current speed\nof the vehicle and the remaining level of gasoline would not be of any help to the driver.\nBoth pieces of information are critical and need to be displayed in distinct, clearly visible\nareas of the dashboard. \n37) At a minimum, in order to measure sustainability, what we need are indicators that\ninform us about the change in the quantities of the different factors that matter for future\nwell-being. Put differently, sustainability requires the simultaneous preservation or\nincrease in several “stocks”: quantities and qualities of natural resources, and of human,\nsocial and physical capital. \n38) There are two versions to the stock approach to sustainability. One version just looks at\nvariations in each stock separately, assessing whether the stock is increase or decreasing,\nwith a view particularly to doing whatever is necessary to keep each above some critical\nthreshold.  The second version converts all these assets into a monetary equivalent,\nthereby implicitly assuming substitutability between different types of capital, so that a\ndecrease in, say, natural capital might be offset by a sufficient increase in physical capital\n(appropriately weighted). Such an approach has significant potential, but also several\nlimitations, the most important being the absence of many markets on which valuation of\nassets could be based. Even when there are market values, there is no guarantee that they\nadequately reflect how the different assets matter for future well-being. The monetary\napproach requires imputations and modelling which raise informational difficulties. All\nthis suggests starting with a more modest approach, i.e. focusing the monetary\naggregation on items for which reasonable valuation techniques exist, such as physical\ncapital, human capital and certain natural resources. In so doing, it should be possible to\nassess the “economic” component of sustainability, that is, whether or not countries are\nover-consuming their economic wealth. \nPhysical indicators for environmental pressures \nRecommendation 12: The environmental aspects of sustainability deserve a separate follow-\nup based on a well-chosen set of physical indicators. In particular there is a need for a clear\n\n18\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nindicator of our proximity to dangerous levels of environmental damage (such as associated\nwith climate change or the depletion of fishing stocks.)\n39) For the reasons mentioned above, placing a monetary value on the natural environment is\noften difficult and separate sets of physical indicators will be needed to monitor the state\nof the environment. This is in particular the case when it comes to irreversible and/or\ndiscontinuous alterations to the environment. For that reason members of the\nCommission believe in particular that there is a need for a clear indicator of increases in\natmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases associated with proximity to dangerous\nlevels of climate change (or levels of emissions that might reasonably be expected to lead\nto such concentrations in the future. Climate change (due to increases in atmospheric\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases) is also special in that it constitutes a truly global\nissue that cannot be measured with regard to national boundaries. Physical indicators of\nthis kind can only be identified with the help of the scientific community. Fortunately, a\ngood deal of work has already been undertaken in this field. \nWhat is next?\n40) The Commission regards its report as opening a discussion rather than closing it. The\nreport hints at issues that ought to be addressed in the context of more comprehensive\nresearch efforts. Other bodies, at the national and international level, should discuss the\nrecommendations in this report, identify their limits, and see how best they can contribute\nto this broad agenda, each from its own perspective.\n41) The Commission believes that a global debate around the issues and recommendations\nraised in this report provides an important venue for a discussion of societal values, for\nwhat we, as a society, care about, and whether we are really striving for what is important\n42) At the national level, round-tables should be established, with the involvement of\nstakeholders, to identify and prioritise those indicators that carry to potential for a shared\nview of how social progress is happening and how it can be sustained over time. \n43) The Commission hopes that this Report will provide the impetus not only for this broader\ndiscussion, but for on-going research into the development of better metrics that will\nenable us to assess better economic performance and social progress.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\nI.  Short  Narrative  on \nthe  Content of the Report \nCHAPTER 1 : CLASSICAL GDP ISSUES\nCHAPTER 2 : QUALITY OF LIFE\nCHAPTER 3 : SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT\n\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n CHAPTER 1  -  CLASSICAL GDP ISSUES 1\n1 - Introduction\n1.\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the most widely used measure of economic activity.\nThere are international standards for its calculation, and much thought has gone into its\nstatistical and conceptual bases. But GDP mainly measures market production, though it has\noften been treated as if it were a measure of economic well-being. Conflating the two can lead\nto misleading indications about how well-off people are and entail the wrong policy\ndecisions. \n2.\nOne reason why money measures of economic performance and living standards have\ncome to play such an important role in our societies is that the monetary valuation of goods\nand services makes it easy to add up quantities of a very different nature. When we know the\nprices of apple juice and DVD players, we can add up their values and make statements about\nproduction and consumption in a single figure. But market prices are more than an accounting\ndevice. Economic theory tells us that when markets are functioning properly, the ratio of one\nmarket price to another is reflective of the relative appreciation of the two products by those\nwho purchase them. Moreover, GDP captures all final goods in the economy, whether they are\nconsumed by households, firms or government. Valuing them with their prices would thus\nseem to be a good way of capturing, in a single number, how well-off society is at a particular\nmoment. Furthermore, keeping prices unchanged while observing how quantities of goods\nand services that enter GDP move over time would seem like a reasonable way of making a\nstatement about how society’s living standards are evolving in real terms.  \n3.\n As it turns out, things are more complicated. First, prices may not exist for some goods\nand services (if for instance government provides free health insurance or if households are\nengaged in child care), raising the question of how these services should be valued. Second,\neven where there are market prices, they may deviate from society’s underlying valuation. In\nparticular, when the consumption or production of particular products affects society as a\nwhole, the price that individuals pay for those products will differ from their value to society\nat large. Environmental damage caused by production or consumption activities that is not\nreflected in market prices is a well-known example.\n4.\nThere is yet another problem. While talking about the concepts of “prices” and\n“quantities” might be straightforward, defining and measuring how they change in practice is\nan altogether different matter. As it happens, many products change over time – they\ndisappear entirely or new features are added to them. Quality change can be very rapid in\nareas like information and communication technologies. There are also products whose\nquality is complex, multi-dimensional and hard to measure, such as medical services,\neducational services, research activities and financial services. Difficulties also arise in\n1.\nEvidence and references in support of the claims presented in this Summary are presented in a companion\ntechnical report.\n\n22\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\ncollecting data in an era when an increasing fraction of sales take place over the internet and\nat sales as well as discount stores. As a consequence, capturing quality change correctly is a\ntremendous challenge for statisticians, yet this is vital to measuring real income and real\nconsumption, some of the key determinants of people’s well-being. Under-estimating quality\nimprovements is equivalent to over-estimating the rate of inflation, and therefore to under-\nestimating real income. For instance, in the mid-1990s, a report reviewing the measurement\nof inflation in the United States (Boskin Commission Report) estimated that insufficient\naccounting for quality improvements in goods and services had led to an annual over-\nestimation of inflation by 0.6%. This led to a series of changes to the US consumer price\nindex.\n5.\nThe debate in Europe has tended to go the opposite way: official price statistics have\nbeen criticized for under-estimating inflation. This has been partly because people’s\nperception of inflation differs from the national averages presented in the consumer price\nindex, and also because it is felt that statisticians over-adjust for quality improvements in\nproducts, thereby painting too rosy a picture of citizens’ real income.        \n6.\n For market prices to be reflective of consumer’s appreciation of goods and services, it\nis also necessary that consumers are free to choose and that they dispose of the relevant\ninformation. It takes little imagination to argue that this is not always the case. Complex\nfinancial products are an example where consumer ignorance prevents market prices from\nplaying their role as carriers of correct economic signals. The complex and ever-changing\nbundles of services offered by telecommunications companies are another case in point where\nit is difficult to ensure the transparency and comparability of price signals. \n7.\n All the above considerations imply that price signals have to be interpreted with care in\ntemporal and spatial comparisons. For a number of purposes, they do not provide a useful\nvehicle for the aggregation of quantities. This does not imply that the use of market prices in\nconstructing measures of economic performance is generally flawed. But it does suggest\nprudence, in particular with regard to the often over-emphasized measure, GDP.\n8.\nThis Chapter suggests five ways of dealing with some of the deficiencies of GDP as an\nindicator of living standards. First, emphasize well-established indicators other than GDP in\nthe national accounts. Second, improve the empirical measurement of key production\nactivities, in particular the provision of health and education services. Third, bring out the\nhousehold perspective, which is most pertinent for considerations of living standards. Fourth,\nadd information about the distribution of income, consumption and wealth to data on the\naverage evolution of these elements. Finally, widen the scope of what is being measured. In\nparticular, a significant part of economic activity takes place outside markets and is often not\nreflected in established national accounts. However, when there are no markets, there are no\nmarket prices, and valuing such activities requires estimates (“imputations”). These are\nmeaningful, but they come at a cost, and we shall discuss them before turning to the other\nproposals.\n2 - Imputations – comprehensiveness versus comprehensibility\n9.\nImputations exist for two related reasons. The first is comprehensiveness. There are\nproductive activities and associated income flows (typically non-monetary) that take place\noutside the market sphere, and some of them have been incorporated into GDP. The single\nmost important imputation is a consumption value for the services that home-owners derive\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n23\nfrom living in their own dwellings. There is no market transaction and no payment takes\nplace, but the national accounts treat this situation as if home-owners paid a rent to\nthemselves. Most people would agree that if two persons receive the same money income but\none of them lives in his/her own house while the other rents, they are not equally well-off –\nhence the imputation in order to better compare incomes over time or between countries. This\nbrings us to the second reason for imputations, the invariance principle: the value of the main\naccounting aggregates should not depend on the institutional arrangements in a country. For\nexample, if exactly the same medical services are provided in one case by the public sector\nand in another case by the private sector, overall measures of production should be unaffected\nby a switch between the two institutional settings. The main advantage of adhering to the\ninvariance principle is better comparability over time and between countries. Therefore, for\ninstance, measures of “adjusted disposable income” for households (see below) include an\nimputation for government services provided directly to citizens. \n10.\nThe imputations can be smaller or larger, depending on the country and on the national\naccounts aggregate considered. In France and Finland, for example, the main imputations\naccount for about one-third of adjusted household disposable income and for just over 20% in\nthe United States. Thus, in the absence of imputations the living standards of French and\nFinnish households would be understated relative to the United States. \n11.\nBut imputations come at a price. One is data quality: imputed values tend to be less\nreliable than observed values. Another is the effect of imputations on the comprehensibility of\nnational accounts. Not all imputations are perceived as income-equivalent by people, and the\nresult may be a discrepancy between changes in perceived income and changes in measured\nincome. This problem is exacerbated when we widen the scope of economic activity to\ninclude other services that are not mediated by the market. Our estimates below for household\nwork amount to around 30% of conventionally-measured GDP. Another 80% or so are added\nwhen leisure is valued as well. It is undesirable to have assumption-driven data so massively\ninfluencing overall aggregates. \n12.\nThere is no easy way out of the tension between comprehensiveness and\ncomprehensibility except to keep both elements of information available for users and to\nmaintain a distinction between core and satellite accounts. A full set of household accounts,\nfor example, may not be well placed in the core of national accounts aggregates. But a\nsatellite account that comes up with a valuation of comprehensive forms of household\nproduction would represent a significant improvement.\n3 - What can be done within the existing measurement framework?\n3.1 - Emphasize national accounts aggregates other than GDP\n13.\nA first step towards mitigating some of the criticism of GDP as a measure of living\nstandards is to emphasize national accounts aggregates other than GDP, for example, by\naccounting for depreciation so as to deal with net rather than gross measures of economic\nactivity. \n14.\nGross measures take no account of the depreciation of capital goods. If a large amount\nof output produced has to be set aside to renew machines and other capital goods, society’s\nability to consume is less than it would have been if only a small amount of set-aside were\n\n24\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nneeded. The reason that economists have relied more heavily on GDP than on net domestic\nproduct (NDP) is, in part, that depreciation is hard to estimate. When the structure of\nproduction remains the same, GDP and NDP move closely together. But in recent years, the\nstructure of production has changed. Information technology (IT) assets have gained\nimportance as capital goods. Computers and software have a shorter life expectancy than do\nsteel mills. On those grounds, the discrepancy between GDP and NDP may be increasing, and\nby implication, volume NDP may be increasing less rapidly than GDP. For example, real\nGDP in the United States rose by about 3% per year during the period 1985-2007.\nDepreciation rose by 4.4% over the same period. As a consequence, real net national product\ngrew at a somewhat slower rate than GDP.  \n15.\nOf greater concern for some countries is that standard depreciation measures have not\ntaken into account the degradation in quality of the natural environment. There have been\nvarious attempts to widen the scope of depreciation to reflect environmental degradation (or\nimprovements, if such is the case), but without much success. The hurdle is the reliable\nmeasurement and monetary valuation of changes in environmental quality.\n16.\nThe case of natural resource depletion is slightly different – there is at least a market\nprice, even if it does not reflect environmental damage attributable to the use of the natural\nresource. Depletion could be captured by excluding the value of the natural resources\nharvested from the production value of sectors like mining and timber. Their production\nwould then consist only in a pure extraction or logging activity, with a corresponding decrease\nin GDP. A second possibility would be to take resource depletion into account in depreciation\nmeasures. In this case, GDP would be unchanged, but NDP would be lower. \n17.\nIn a world of globalization, there may be large differences between the income of a\ncountry’s citizens and measures of domestic production, but the former is clearly more\nrelevant for measuring the well-being of citizens. We shall argue later that the household\nsector is particularly relevant for our considerations, and for households the income\nperspective is much more appropriate than measures of production. Some of the income\ngenerated by residents is sent abroad, and some residents receive income from abroad. These\nflows are captured by net national disposable income, a standard variable in national\naccounts. Figure 1.1 below shows how Ireland’s income declines relative to its GDP – a\nreflection of an increasing share of profits that are repatriated by foreign investors. While the\nprofits are included in GDP, they do not enhance the spending power of the country’s citizens.\nFor a poor developing country to be told that its GDP has gone up may be of little relevance.\nIt wants to know whether its citizens are better-off, and national income measures are more\nrelevant to this question than GDP.  \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n25\nFigure 1.1. Net national disposable income as percentage of gross domestic product\nSource: OECD Annual National Accounts.\n18.\nMoreover, the prices of imports evolve very differently from the prices of exports, and\nthese changes in relative prices have to be taken into account in assessing living standards.\nThe figure below shows the divergence between real income and production in Norway, an\noil-rich OECD country whose income has risen faster than GDP in times of rising oil prices.\nIn many developing countries, whose export prices have tended to fall relative to import\nprices, the opposite will be true. \nFigure 1.2.

Retail services are a case in point. In principle, numerous aspects should be taken into\naccount in measuring the services provided: the volume of goods transacted but also the\nquality of service (accessibility of the shop, general service level of the staff, choice and\npresentation of products and so forth). It is difficult even to define these services, let alone to\nmeasure them. Statistical offices generally use data on the volume of sales as indicators for\nthe volume of trade services. This method leaves aside most quality change in the trade\nservices provided. What is true for retail holds for many other service industries, including\nthose that are often publicly provided, such as health and education. A greater effort will be\nneeded to come to grips with tracking the quantity and quality of services in modern\neconomies. \n3.3 - Improving the measurement of government-provided services in particular\n20.\nGovernments play an important part in today’s economies. Broadly speaking, they\nprovide two types of services – those of a “collective” nature, such as security, and those of an\n“individual” nature, such as medical services and education. This does not imply that\ngovernment is necessarily the only provider of these services, and indeed, the mix between\nprivate and public provision of individual services varies significantly across countries. And\nwhile one can argue about the contribution of collective services to citizens’ living standards,\nindividual services, particularly education, medical services and public sports facilities, are\nalmost certainly valued positively by citizens. These services tend to be large in scale but\nbadly measured. Traditionally, for government-provided non-market services, measures have\nbeen based on the inputs used to produce these services rather than on the actual outputs\nproduced. An immediate consequence of this procedure is that productivity change for\ngovernment-provided services is ignored, because outputs are taken to move at the same\nrhythm as inputs. It follows that if there is positive productivity growth in the public sector,\nour measures under-estimate growth.\n21.\nWork has started in many countries to develop output measures for these government-\nprovided services that are independent of inputs, but the task is formidable. Take the\nfollowing example: the United States spends more per capita on health care than many\nEuropean countries, yet in terms of standard health indicators, outcomes are worse. Does this\nmean that Americans receive less health care? Or does it mean their health care is more\nexpensive and/or delivered less efficiently? Or does it mean that health outcomes also depend\non factors specific to American society other than health expenditure? We need to break down\nthe change in health expenditure into a price and an output effect. But what exactly are the\nvolumes of output that one is looking for? It is tempting to measure them by the population’s\nstate of health. The problem is that the link between health care expenditure and health status\nis tenuous at best: expenditures relate to the resources that go into the institutions providing\nhealth services, whereas the health status of the population is driven by many factors – and the\nsituation is much the same for education. For example, people’s lifestyles will affect health\noutcomes, and the time parents spend with their children will affect exam scores. Attributing\nchanges in health or education status solely to hospitals or schools and the money spent on\nthem neglects all these factors and can be misleading.    \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n27\n22.\nThe quest is for more accurate measures of the volume growth of public services. A\nnumber of European countries as well as Australia and New Zealand have developed output-\nbased measures for key government-provided services. One major challenge to these efforts\nis, once again, to capture quality change. Without a good measure of quality (or equivalently,\na good estimate of increases in productivity), it is impossible to ascertain whether the\nconventional input measures underestimate or overestimate growth. If undifferentiated\nquantity measures are used, such as a simple number of students or of patients, changes in the\ncomposition and quality of the output may be missed. But one has to start somewhere and,\nbecause the numbers involved are important, the issue cannot be ignored, For example, with\noutput-based measures, the U.K. economy grew at a rate of 2.75% per year between 1995 and\n2003, whereas if the previous convention had continued to be used, the growth rate would\nhave been 3% (Atkinson 2005). Similar effects could be observed in the case of France. A\nDanish study on the measurement of health output points the other way: output-based\nproduction of health services grew more rapidly than input-based production (Figure 1.3.\nVolume output of health services in Denmark).\n23.\nAn important criterion for the reliability of output-based measures is that they are based\non observations that are detailed enough to avoid mixing up true volume changes with\ncompositional effects. We can ask how many students are educated, and simply count their\nnumbers. If spending per student increases, one might conclude that the unit cost of\neducational services has increased. This may be misleading, however, if costs have gone up\nbecause students are taught in smaller classes or if there is a larger share of students that take\nup engineering studies, which are more costly. The measurement mistake arises because the\nsimple number of students is too undifferentiated an output measure to be meaningful, so a\nmore detailed structure is needed. It would help, for instance, to treat one hour taught to a\ngraduate engineering student as a different product from one hour taught to a first-year arts\nstudent, and thus to account for some quality and compositional change. A similar reasoning\napplies for health care: the treatments of different diseases have to be considered as different\nmedical services. As it turns out, the health-care systems of some countries do provide the\nadministrative data needed to obtain this detailed information. We conclude that despite this\nbeing a daunting task, the better measurement of government-provided individual services is\ncentral to the better assessment of living standards. Exploiting new administrative data\nsources is one way of making progress in this direction. Ideally, the information would also\ncapture service quality, for instance, the way patients are accommodated in hospitals or the\ntime devoted to them by the medical staff, though such data may be hard to collect. In this\ncase, new primary data sources such as surveys may be necessary.    \n\n28\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nFigure 1.3. Volume output of health services in Denmark\nSource: Deveci, Heurlén and Sørensen (2008) “Non-Market Health Care Service in Denmark – Empirical\nStudies of A, B and C Methods”; paper presented at the meeting of the International Association for Research\non Income and Wealth, Slovenia. \n24.\nImproving the volume measures of outputs does not dispense with the need to improve\n– and publish – the volume measures of inputs. Only if both the outputs and inputs of service\nproduction are well captured will it be possible to estimate productivity change and undertake\nproductivity comparisons across countries. \n3.4 - Revisit the concept of “defensive” expenditures\n25.\nExpenditures required to maintain consumption levels or the functioning of society\ncould be viewed as a sort of intermediate input – there is no direct benefit, and in this sense\nthey do not give rise to a final good or service. Nordhaus and Tobin, in their seminal 1973\npaper, for example, identify as “defensive” those activities that “are evidently not directly\nsources of utility themselves but are regrettably necessary inputs to activities that may yield\nutility”. In particular, they adjust income downwards for expenditures that arise as a\nconsequence of urbanization and a complex modern life. Many such “defensive expenditures”\nare incurred by government, while others are incurred by the private sector. By way of\nexample, expenditure on prisons could be considered a government-incurred defensive\nexpenditure and the costs of commuting to work a privately-incurred defensive expenditure.\nA number of authors have suggested treating these expenditures as intermediate rather than\nfinal products. Consequently, they would not be part of GDP. \n26.\n At the same time, difficulties abound when it comes to identifying which expenditures\nare “defensive” and which are not. For instance, if a new park is opened, does this constitute\ndefensive expenditure against the disamenties of urban life or is it a non-defensive\nrecreational service? What are the possible ways forward? Some options include:\nFirst, focus on household consumption rather than total final consumption. For many\npurposes, the former is a more meaningful variable. And all of governments’ collective\nconsumption expenditures (which would include things like prisons, military\n100.0\n102.0\n104.0\n106.0\n108.0\n110.0\n112.0\n114.0\n116.0\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\nOutput‐based\nInput‐based\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n29\nexpenditure and the clean-up of oil spills) are automatically excluded from household\nfinal consumption. \nSecond, widen the asset boundary. In many cases, defensive expenditures include\nelements of investment and capital goods. In those cases, they should be treated much\nlike maintenance expenditures in the case of conventional production. For example,\nhealth expenditures could be seen as investment in human capital instead of as final\nconsumption. If there is an asset that captures environmental quality, expenditures made\nto improve or maintain it could also be considered an investment. Conversely, the\nconsequences of economic activity that is detrimental to this asset could be captured in\nan extended measure of depreciation or depletion so that the net measure of income or\nproduction is reduced accordingly. And net measures, it was argued earlier, should be\nour benchmark for living standards rather than gross measures.\nThird, widen the household production boundary. Some “defensive” expenditures\ncannot reasonably be treated as an investment. Take the case of commuting to work.\nHouseholds produce transportation services – they use their time (labour input) and\nmoney (commuter ticket) for this purpose. With the exception of the consumer’s\npurchase of a ticket for a commuter train, which counts as final consumption, none of\nthe above flows enter measures of production and income. This could be remedied by\nallowing for the household production of transportation services, which would be\nconsidered as an unpaid delivery of intermediate inputs to firms, “subsidized” by\nprivate households. Although this treatment would not change overall GDP, it would\nshow a larger contribution to production by households and a smaller contribution by\nfirms.\n27.\nThe biggest obstacle to these approaches lies in their implementation. How exactly\nshould the scope of defensive expenditures be determined? How should new assets and in-\nkind flows be valued? And, of course, widening the scope of asset and production measures\nbrings with it more imputations. \n3.5 - Income, wealth and consumption have to be considered together\n28.\nIncome flows are an important gauge for the standard of living, but in the end it is\nconsumption and consumption possibilities over time that matter. The time dimension brings\nin wealth. A low-income household with above-average wealth is better off than a low-\nincome household without wealth. The existence of wealth is also one reason why income and\nconsumption are not necessarily equal: for a given income, consumption can be raised by\nrunning down assets or by increasing debt, and consumption can be reduced by saving and\nadding to assets. For this reason, wealth is an important indicator of the sustainability of\nactual consumption. \n29.\nThe same holds for the economy as a whole. To construct the balance sheet of an\neconomy, we need to have comprehensive accounts of its assets (physical capital – and\nprobably human, natural and social capital) and its liabilities (what is owed to other\ncountries.) To know what is happening to the economy, we need to ascertain changes in\nwealth. In some instances, it may be easier to account for changes in wealth than to estimate\nthe total value of wealth. Changes in wealth entail gross investments (in physical, natural,\nhuman and social capital) minus depreciation and depletion in those same assets.\n\n30\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n30.\nAlthough information about some central aspects of household wealth is in principle\navailable from national accounts balance sheets, it is often incomplete. Furthermore, certain\nassets are not recognized as such in the standard accounting framework, not least of all human\ncapital. Studies that have computed monetary estimates of human capital stocks found that\nthey account for an overwhelming part of all wealth (80% or more). A systematic\nmeasurement of human capital stock is of interest from a number of perspectives. It\nconstitutes an integral part of an extended measure of household production (see below), and\nit is an input for the construction of sustainability indicators.\n31.\nNote a fundamental problem with valuing stocks. When there are markets for assets, the\nprices at which assets are bought and sold serve to value the stock as a whole. But there may\nbe no markets for certain assets or no trading on the markets, as has recently been the case for\ncertain financial assets. This raises the question of how to value them. And even when market\nprices do exist, transactions correspond only to a small fraction of the existing stock, and they\nmay be so volatile as to put a question mark on the interpretability of balance sheets. That\nsaid, basic information on assets and liabilities is key to assessing the economic health of the\nvarious sectors and the financial risks to which they are exposed. \n4 - Bringing out the household perspective\n32.\nIncome can be computed for private households as well as for the economy as a whole.\nSome of citizens’ income is taken away in the form of taxes, and so is not at their disposal.\nBut the government takes this money away for a reason: to provide public goods and services,\nto invest, for example, in infrastructure, and to transfer income to other (normally more\nneedy) individuals. A commonly employed measure of household income adds and subtracts\nthese transfer payments. The resulting measure is referred to as a measure of household\ndisposable income. However, disposable income captures only monetary transfers between\nhouseholds and the government, thereby neglecting the in-kind services that government\nprovides. \n4.1 - Adjusting household income measures for government services in kind \n33.\nEarlier in this text we mentioned the invariance principle, according to which a\nmovement of an activity from the public to the private sector, or vice versa, should not change\nour measure of performance, except to the extent that there is an effect on quality or access.\nThis is where a purely market-based measure of income meets its limits and where a measure\nthat corrects for differences in institutional arrangements may be warranted for comparisons\nover time or across countries. Adjusted disposable income is a national accounts measure that\ngoes some way towards accommodating the invariance principle, at least where “social\ntransfers in kind” by government are concerned. \n34.\nThe meaning of adjusted disposable income is best explained by way of an example\n(Table 1.1). Assume that a society’s labour income equals 100 and that individuals who are\nactive in the labour market buy private health insurance. They make an annual payment for\nthe insurance equal to 10, which can be decomposed into 8 units of insurance premiums (the\nactuarial value of a payment of 8) and 2 units of consumption of insurance services. At the\nsame time, persons who are sick receive 8 units as reimbursement of their health\nexpenditures. In this case – let us call it Case A – no taxes are paid and insurance claims and\npremiums offset each other, so that household disposable income equals 100. Now, assume\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n31\nthat the government decides to provide the same amount of health insurance coverage to\neveryone, funded through a tax of 10 units. Nothing has changed, other than that the\ngovernment is now collecting the insurance payment and distributing the benefits (Case B).\nBut according to standard national accounts statistics, household disposable income has\nfallen, to 90 currency units. Thus, disposable income here yields a distorted comparison. If\none adds in the social transfers in kind that households receive from the government under\nCase B (8 units corresponding to the reimbursement of health expenditures and 2 units\ncorresponding to the running costs of the insurance), the adjusted measure of household\ndisposable income indicates equality between the two cases. \n35.\nThe above example leaves aside, however, any consideration about which insurance\nregime operates more cost effectively and about the profits that might be made by private\ninsurance companies – it was simply assumed that the private and public insurance services\nare equivalent to 2 currency units. In practice, this is almost certainly not the case, although it\nis difficult to make a general observation about the relative efficiency of such schemes. If the\ninsurance services industry is not perfectly competitive (a reasonable assumption in most\ncountries), the transfer of responsibility from the private to the public sector will be reflected\nin decreased profits and decreased insurance prices. Even if profits are distributed to\nhouseholds in the form of dividends, the change in the form of provision (from private to\npublic) can increase the accessibility of the insurance service. Having an opportunity to insure\nagainst certain types of risks has a positive impact on the well-being of people who are risk\nadverse.\nTable  1.1. Private and public insurance schemes\n36.\nWhile the failure to estimate the value of the insurance services provided causes one set\nof biases, there are other biases that arise from the fact that the value of some social transfers\nin kind (those corresponding to the running costs of the insurance in the example above) is\nPrivate insurance scheme \n(Case A)\nPublic insurance scheme \n(Case B)\nLabour income\n100\n100\nTax\n0\n-   10\nInsurance premiums \n(excluding insurance \nservices)\n-    8\n0\nInsurance claims\n+   8\n0\nHousehold disposable \nincome\n100\n90\nSocial transfers in kind : \n  – reimbursements\n  – running costs of \n     the insurance\n0\n+  10\n     +    8\n     +    2\nAdjusted household \ndisposable income\n100\n100\n\n32\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nmeasured by the cost of producing these services. In some countries, in particular in the\ndeveloping world, the cost of these services may greatly exceed their value to households,\nwho may receive little or nothing. In this situation, the result of using adjusted household\nincome would be a large-scale overestimation of the level of household income and\nconsumption. Some of this can be tackled by using output-based volume measures for the\nhealth and education services produced by government. It is also likely that different parts of\nthe population benefit unequally from social transfers in kind provided by government. There\nis thus an important distributional aspect.\n37.\nMajor items included in social transfers in kind are health and education services,\nsubsidized housing, sport and recreation facilities and the like that are provided to citizens at a\nlow price or for free. In France, general government provides nearly all of these services,\nwhich in 2007 cost about € 290 billion. Education and health services each account for about\none-third of total transfers in kind, and housing and recreational and cultural activities\n(museums, public parks, etc.) account for about 10% (Figure 1.4. Social transfers in kind from\ngeneral government, France 2007). \nFigure 1.4. Social transfers in kind from general government, France 2007\nSource: INSEE.\n4.2 - Medians and means – distribution of income, consumption and wealth\n38.\nAverage measures of per-capita income and wealth give no indication of how the\navailable resources are distributed across persons or households. Similarly, average\nconsumption gives no indication of how people effectively benefit from these resources. For\nexample, average income per capita can remain unchanged while the distribution of income\nbecomes less equal. It is therefore necessary to look at disposable income, consumption and\nwealth information for different groups. A conceptually simple way of capturing distribution\naspects is to measure median income (the income such that half of all individuals are above\nthat income, and half below), median consumption and median wealth. The median individual\nis, in some sense, the “typical” individual. If inequality increases, the differences between\nmedians and averages may well increase, so a focus on averages does not give an accurate\nEducation\n30%\nHealth services\n34%\nPharmaceuticals\n9%\nSocial work\n9%\nRecreational \nfacilities and \nactivities\n6%\nReal estate\n4%\nOther\n8%\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n33\npicture of the economic well-being of the “typical” member of society. For example, if all the\nincreases in societal income accrue, say, to those in the top 10%, median income may remain\nunchanged, while average income increases. Over the past two decades, the dominant pattern\nin OECD countries is one of a fairly widespread increase in income inequality, with strong\nrises in Finland, Norway, Sweden (from a low base) and Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and\nthe United States (from a high base). In these cases, medians and means would give different\npictures of what is happening to societal well-being. Alternatively, changes in the disposable\nincome of different income groups can be tracked. Such an approach would, for instance, look\nat the numbers of people below a critical income level, or the average income of those in the\nbottom or top decile. Similar calculations would be useful for consumption and wealth.\nEmpirical research has repeatedly shown that the distribution of consumption can be quite\ndifferent from the distribution of income. Indeed, the most pertinent measures of the\ndistribution of material living standards are probably based on jointly considering the income,\nconsumption and wealth position of households or individuals. \n39.\nIn practice, moving from averages to medians is more difficult than meets the eye.\nMeasures of averages are obtained by dividing aggregates by a population figure. To consider\ndistributional elements, micro-economic information is needed that provides information for\nindividual households or groups of households. Micro-economic measures refer to people\nliving in private households and are typically derived from household income surveys,\nwhereas macro-economic measures from the national accounts are based on a range of\ndifferent sources, and include people living in collective households (such as prisons and\ninstitutions for long-term care). \n40.\nAn important choice also concerns the unit of measurement. Macro-estimates give\ntotals for a whole country or sector, while micro-data retain the household (or the family) as\nthe unit within which resources are pooled and shared, and adjust income for differences in\n“needs”. There are, for instance, fixed costs to running a household, allowing larger families\nwith the same per-capita income to have a higher standard of living. Another step towards\nbringing demography and some distributional aspects into income measures is to calculate\ndisposable income per consumption unit rather than per person. Consumption units are\nhouseholds whose size has been adjusted to take account of economies of scale in housing\nand other costs. This adjustment is of increasing importance as household size shrinks. \n41.\nAgainst this background, we can consider the evolution of average and median\nhousehold income in several countries. Figure 1.5. Trends in different measures of household\ndisposable income shows some results for France and the United States. Average income per\ncapita and average income per consumption unit diverge, reflecting a trend towards a smaller\nhousehold size. Survey income measures permit comparing average and median income. In\nthe case of France, these two items move in parallel. At least from this perspective, there is no\nindication of a widening income distribution. The picture is different for the United States,\nwhere average income per capita and per consumption unit grow at the same rate but where\nthere is a widening gap between median and average income, pointing to a more unequal\nincome distribution. \n\n34\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nFigure 1.5. Trends in different measures of household disposable income\n42.\nThere are many measurement issues that can influence the above statements. One\nsource of discrepancy between micro- and macro-estimates is property income, whether\nimputed or not. If this aggregate is not well measured in micro-estimates, this could explain\nwhy average and median incomes in these estimates move in parallel in France, where wage\ninequalities are less important than property income inequalities. In addition, there is a\npossibility that top incomes are under-represented in household income surveys. Finally, the\ninternational comparability between household surveys is far from perfect.\n43.\nFrom the perspective of living standards, what matters is that the distribution of income,\nconsumption and wealth determines who enjoys access to the goods and services produced\nwithin a society. Complementing measures of average income by measures with a\ndistributional element is thus a crucial task for official statistics. Ideally, such distributional\nmeasures should be compatible in scope with average measures from the national accounts.\n44.\nSimilarly, the distribution of the volume of consumption is also important. The same\ndollar may buy different bundles of products, depending on the income group of the\npurchaser. Going from nominal to real income and from the value to the volume of\nconsumption means applying a price index, raising the question of whose price index are we\nmeasuring. Conceptual discussions about price indices are often conducted as there exists a\nsingle representative consumer. Statistical agencies calculate the increase in prices by looking\nat what it costs to purchase an average bundle of goods. The problem is that different people\nbuy different bundles of goods, e.g. poor people spend more on food, and rich people on\nentertainment. People also buy goods and services in different types of stores, which sell\n“similar” products at very different prices. When all prices move together, having different\nindices for different people may not make much difference. But recently, with soaring oil and\nfood prices, these differences have become marked. Those at the bottom may have seen real\nincomes be more affected than those at the top. \nSource: Computations based on OECD SNA and income distribution data.\n \nUnited States\n0.90\n1.00\n1.10\n1.20\n1.30\n1.40\n1.50\n1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nAverage per capita incom e, SN A\nAverage per consum ption unit, SN A\nAverage per consum ption unit, survey\nM edian per consum ption unit, survey\n \nFrance\n0.90\n1.00\n1.10\n1.20\n1.30\n1.40\n1.50\n1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nAverage per capita income, SNA\nAverage per consumption unit, SNA\nAverage per consumption unit, survey\nMedian per consumption unit, survey\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n35\n45.\nA price index for (actual) private consumption for major groups in society (age, income,\nrural/urban) is necessary if we are to appraise their economic situation. One of the\nrecommendations of the Commission sur la mesure du pouvoir d’achat des ménages (2008)\n(Commission on the measurement of household purchasing power) in France was to develop\nconsumer price indices for owners of dwellings, for households who rent dwellings and for\nhouseholds who are about to purchase dwellings. A full development of price indices\ndifferentiated by socio-economic group requires, however, that different prices be collected\nfor different segments of the population, so that socio-economic aspects are taken into\naccount in the data collection design. This is likely to prove difficult and costly, and should\nconstitute a medium-term research objective – a recommendation that echoes a similar\nconclusion by the 2002 Panel on Conceptual, Measurement, and other Statistical Issues in\nDeveloping Cost-of-Living Indices in the United States. Such work would not only enhance\nthe quality of deflation procedures, it would also make it easier for citizens to compare their\npersonal situation with some of the income and price data released by statistical offices. \n4.3 - Broader measures of household economic activity\n46.\nThere have been major changes in how households and society function. For example,\nmany of the services people received from other family members in the past are now\npurchased on the market. This shift translates into a rise in income as measured in the national\naccounts and gives a false impression of a change in living standards, while it merely reflects\na shift from non-market to market provision of services. Just as we argued that a shift from\nprivate to public provision of a particular good or service, or vice-versa, should not affect\nmeasured output, so too, a shift of production from household to market production, or vice-\nversa, should not affect measured output. We noted earlier that, in practice, current\nconventions do, however, lead to changes in measured income in both instances.  \n47.\nImagine a two-parent household with two children and an income of 50,000 currency\nunits a year, in which only one parent works full-time for pay and the other specializes in\nhome production. The parent who stays at home does all the shopping, cooks all the meals,\ndoes all the cleaning, and performs all the child care. As a result, this household does not need\nto devote any of its market income to purchasing these services. Now imagine a two-parent\nhousehold with two children in which both parents work full-time for the same global pay\n(50,000 a year), and neither parent has any time left over for household production or child\ncare. They must pay for all the shopping, cooking, cleaning and child care out of pocket.\nTheir available income is therefore reduced. Conventional measures treat these two\nhouseholds as if they have identical living standards, but obviously they don’t. Focusing on\nmarket production provides a biased picture of living standards – some of the measured\nincrease in market production may simply reflect a shift of the locus of production from\nhouseholds to the market.  \n48.\nTo get a sense of how important home production is economically, one has to start by\nexamining how people use their time. Figure 1.6. Housework, paid work and leisure1.6\nprovides a first comparison of time spent per household and per day on various activities.\nHousehold production comprises time spent on housework, purchasing goods and services,\ncaring for and helping household and non-household members, volunteer activities, telephone\ncalls, mail and email, and travel time related to all these activities. “Personal care” consists\nmainly of sleeping, eating and drinking, whereas leisure was defined to include sports,\nreligious and spiritual activities and other leisure activities.  \n\n36\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n49.\n Based on these definitions, more time is spent on household production in European\ncountries than in the United States, and more time is spent on leisure in Finland, France, Italy,\nGermany and the United Kingdom than in the United States (Figure 1.6. Housework, paid\nwork and leisure). Note that some of the classifications are ambiguous, so the results should\nbe read with care. For example, eating and drinking are included in the definition of personal\ncare, whereas, arguably, some eating and drinking is time spent on leisure. The time-use\npicture would also change if eating time were allocated differently. We conclude that the\nallocation of specific activities to time-use categories as well as their international\ncomparison leaves room for improvement and harmonisation. \nFigure 1.6. Housework, paid work and leisure\nMinutes per day and person, latest year available*\nNote.

Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries; Paris.\n \n50.\nIf we gloss over these issues, it is possible to come up with an illustrative calculation of\nthe value of household production for France, Finland and the United States. The approach\nchosen here is simple: the value of the production of household services is measured by its\ncost. The value of labor is estimated by applying the wage rate of a generalist household\nworker to the number of hours that people spend on housework. Methodology matters in this\ncontext and results can differ markedly, depending in particular on the hypotheses chosen for\nthe valuation of labor and capital. We also lack estimates for productivity changes in\nhousehold production.  \n 51.\nHowever, our estimates do provide orders of magnitude. It is apparent, and no surprise\nin light of previous studies, that imputations for own-account production of household\nservices are sizeable in all countries. Household production amounts to about 35% of\nconventionally-measured GDP in France (average 1995-2006), about 40% in Finland and\n30% in the United States over the same period. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n37\n52.\nOnce one starts thinking about non-market income, one also has to think about leisure.\nWith time spent on generating income (market or non-market), we buy or produce goods and\nservices to meet our needs or for simple enjoyment. Time available for leisure obviously\naffects well-being. Changes in the amount of leisure over time and differences between\ncountries represent one of the more important aspects of the situation of well-being in these\nrespects. Focusing only on goods and services can therefore bias comparative measures of\nliving standards. This is of particular concern as the world begins to come to terms with\nenvironmental constraints. It may not be possible to increase the production, especially of\ngoods, beyond limit, because of the environmental damage that this would entail. Taxes and\nregulations may be imposed that will discourage production. However, it would be a mistake\nif, as a result of these measures, we were to conclude that living standards have fallen when\nleisure time (and environmental quality) has increased. As society progresses, it is not\nunreasonable to expect people to enjoy some of the fruits of that progress in the form of\nleisure. Different societies may respond differently to higher living standards, and we do not\nwant to bias our judgments (e.g. of success) against societies that choose to enjoy more\nleisure.\n53.\nMeasurement of the value of leisure starts, once again, from time-use data. We multiply\nthe average leisure time per day by the working-age population and then by the average wage\nrate in the economy. Again, this procedure raises many measurement issues, but the purpose\nhere is to show that estimates are feasible and can produce meaningful cross-country\ncomparisons. For the three countries at hand, the value of leisure roughly doubles net\nhousehold disposable income in nominal terms. More interesting than nominal income levels\nis the question of how considering leisure affects the measured growth rates of real income\nand their comparisons across countries. This is captured in Table 1.2. Household income in\nreal terms. It shows the evolution of household income, now adjusted for household work\n(upper panel) and for household work and leisure (lower panel). For all countries, the new\nreal income measures grow more slowly than the traditional measures of income. When\nexpressed as income per consumption unit (i.e. per household, adjusted for household size),\nthe income growth rates of the three countries turn out to be very similar.  \nTable 1.2.

These\nare orders of magnitude at best and should not be over-interpreted. However, it is clear that\nthe recognition of broader measures of economic activity and of leisure does make a\ndifference to comparisons over time and between countries. More work needs to be done to\ntest methodologies, to single out the most critical parameters and to test the robustness of such\nmeasures. Only if there is sufficient confidence in extended measures of income will there be\na broader take-up by statistical offices. \n55.\nMore instructive than estimating the rate of change in real income is assessing how\nhousehold production and leisure bear on the comparison of income levels across countries.\nIncome levels should be compared in real terms, so we construct currency converters, so-\ncalled Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) that permit comparisons of “full” income (including\nhousework and leisure) across countries. Figure 1.7. Real income per capita in France\ncompared to the United States, 2005 compares three income aggregates for France and the\nUnited States. The first comparison uses the established disposable income measure. Here,\nFrance’s per-capita income is about 66% of the comparable United States figure. Adding in\ngovernment-provided services such as health and education narrows the gap to 79%. If, in\naddition, housework and leisure are accounted for, one ends up with a relative income level of\n87%.     \nFigure 1.7. Real income per capita in France compared to the United States, 2005\nUnites States = 100\n4.4 - Distribution of full income\n56.\nIt was argued earlier that measures of average income should be accompanied by\nmeasures that also provide distributional information. The rationale for examining income\ndistribution holds for market income, but also for broader measures, such as full income. The\nrecognition of the own-account production of household services and leisure affects aggregate\nmeasures of income and production, but may also change the established picture of income\ndistribution.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nUnadjusted \ndisposable household \nincome\nAdjusted disposable \nhousehold income\nAdjusted disposable \nhousehold Income \nincluding housework\nAdjusted disposable \nhousehold Income \nincluding housework \nand leisure\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n39\n57.\n Developing distributional measures of full income is, however, a formidable task. The\nmost difficult challenge is to allocate to various groups those income flows that have been\nimputed at the macro level when comprehensive measures of income were derived, for\nexample, imputed rents from own-occupied housing. Other imputations for own-account\nservices produced by households also fall under this category, as do the distributional effects\nof government services that are provided in kind.\n58.\nAgain, measurement difficulties should not prevent us from developing a more\ncomprehensive picture of the distribution of income and wealth. The distribution of full\nincome should be firmly anchored in the research agenda.\n4.5 - Main messages and recommendations\nRecommendation 1: Look at income and consumption rather than production.\n59.\nGDP is the most widely-used measure of economic activity. There are international\nstandards for its calculation, and much thought has gone into its statistical and conceptual\nbases. But GDP mainly measures market production, though it has often been treated as if it\nwere a measure of economic well-being. Conflating the two can lead to misleading\nindications about how well-off people are and entail the wrong policy decisions. Material\nliving standards are more closely associated with measures of real income and consumption –\nproduction can expand while income decreases or vice versa when account is taken of\ndepreciation, income flows into and out of a country, and differences between the prices of\noutput and the prices of consumer products.\nRecommendation 2: Consider income and consumption jointly with wealth.\n60.\nIncome and consumption are crucial for assessing living standards, but in the end they\ncan only be gauged in conjunction with information on wealth. A vital indicator of the\nfinancial status of a firm is its balance sheet, and the same holds for the economy as a whole.\nTo construct the balance sheet of an economy, we need comprehensive accounts of its assets\n(physical capital – and probably even human, natural and social capital) and its liabilities\n(what is owed to other countries). Balance sheets for countries are not novel in concept, but\ntheir availability is still limited and their construction should be promoted. There is also a\nneed to “stress test” balance sheets with alternative valuations when market prices for assets\nare not available or are subject to bubbles and bursts. Measures of wealth are also central to\nmeasuring sustainability. What is carried over into the future necessarily has to be expressed\nas stocks – of physical, natural, human or social capital. Here too the right valuation of these\nstocks plays a crucial role.\nRecommendation 3: Emphasise the household perspective.\n61.\nWhile it is informative to track the performance of economies as a whole, trends in\ncitizens’ material living standards are better followed through measures of household income\nand consumption. Indeed, the available national accounts data shows that in a number of\nOECD countries real household income has grown quite differently from real GDP, and\ntypically at a lower rate. The household perspective entails taking account of payments\nbetween sectors, such as taxes going to government, social benefits coming from government,\nand interest payments on household loans going to financial corporations. Properly defined,\n\n40\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nhousehold income and consumption should also reflect the value of in-kind services provided\nby government, such as subsidized health care and educational services.  \nRecommendation 4: Give more prominence to the distribution of income, consumption and\nwealth.\n62.\nAverage income, consumption and wealth are meaningful statistics, but they do not tell\nthe whole story about living standards. For example, a rise in average income could be\nunequally shared across groups, leaving some households relatively worse-off than others.\nThus, average measures of income, consumption and wealth should be accompanied by\nindicators that reflect their distribution. Ideally, such information should not come in isolation\nbut be linked, i.e. one would like information about how well-off households are with regard\nto all three dimensions of material living standards: income, consumption and wealth. After\nall, a low-income household with above-average wealth is not necessarily worse-off than a\nmedium-income household with no wealth. The desirability of disposing of information on\nthe “joint distribution” of dimensions will be encountered once again in Recommendation 3\nof the Chapter on the quality of life. \nRecommendation 5: Broaden income measures to non-market activities.\n 63.\nThere have been major changes in how households and society function. For example,\nmany of the services people received from other family members in the past are now\npurchased on the market. This shift translates into a rise in income as measured in the national\naccounts and may give a false impression of a change in living standards, while it merely\nreflects a shift from non-market to market provision of services. Many services that\nhouseholds produce for themselves are not recognized in official income and production\nmeasures, yet they constitute an important aspect of economic activity. While their exclusion\nfrom official measures reflects uncertainty about data more than it does conceptual dissent,\nmore and more systematic work in this area should be undertaken. This should start with\ninformation on how people spend their time that is comparable both over the years and across\ncountries. Comprehensive and periodic accounts of household activity as satellites to the core\nnational accounts should complement the picture.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\nCHAPTER 2   -  QUALITY OF LIFE 2\n1 - Introduction\n65.\nQuality of life is a broader concept than economic production and living standards. It\nincludes the full range of factors that influences what we value in living, reaching beyond its\nmaterial side. While some extensions of economic accounting (discussed in Chapter 1) allow\nincluding some of the elements that shape quality of life in conventional measures of\neconomic well-being, every approach based on resources (or on people’s command over\ncommodities) remains limited in important ways. First, resources are means that are\ntransformed into well-being in ways that differ across people: individuals with greater\ncapacities for enjoyment or greater abilities for achievement in valuable domains of life may\nbe better off even if they command fewer economic resources. Second, many resources are\nnot marketed, and even when they are, prices will differ across individuals, making it\nproblematic to compare real income across people. Finally, many of the determinants of\nhuman well-being are aspects of people’s life-circumstances: they cannot be described as\nresources with imputable prices, even if people do make trade-offs among them. These\narguments by themselves are sufficient to suggest that resources are an insufficient metric for\nquality of life. Which other metric should be used instead for assessing quality of life depends\non the philosophical perspective taken.\n66.\nWhile a long tradition of philosophical thought has addressed the issues of what gives\nlife its quality, recent advances in research have led to measures that are both new and\ncredible. This research suggests that the need to move beyond measures of economic\nresources is not limited to developing countries (the traditional focus of much work on\n“human development” in the past) but is even more salient for rich industrialised countries.\nThese measures, while not replacing conventional economic indicators, provide an\nopportunity to enrich policy discussions and to inform people’s view of the conditions of the\ncommunities where they live. More importantly, the new measures now have the potential to\nmove from research to standard statistical practice. While some of them reflect structural\nconditions that are relatively invariant over time but that differ systematically across\ncountries, others are more responsive to policies and more suitable for monitoring changes\nover shorter periods of time. Both types of indicator play an important role in evaluating\nquality of life.\n2.\nEvidence and references in support of the claims presented in this Summary are presented in a companion\ntechnical report.\n\n42\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n2 - Conceptual approaches to measuring quality of life\n67.\nThree conceptual approaches have retained the attention of the Commission as useful in\nthinking about how to measure quality of life.\n• The first approach, developed in close connection with psychological research, is based\non the notion of subjective well-being. A long philosophical tradition views individuals\nas the best judges of their own conditions. This approach is closely linked to the\nutilitarian tradition but has a broader appeal due to the strong presumption in many\nstreams of ancient and modern culture that enabling people to be “happy” and\n“satisfied” with their life is a universal goal of human existence. \n• The second approach is rooted in the notion of capabilities. This approach conceives a\nperson’s life as a combination of various “doings and beings” (functionings) and of his\nor her freedom to choose among these functionings (capabilities). Some of these\ncapabilities may be quite elementary, such as being adequately nourished and escaping\npremature mortality, while others may be more complex, such as having the literacy\nrequired to participate actively in political life. The foundations of the capability\napproach, which has strong roots in philosophical notions of social justice, reflect a\nfocus on human ends and on respecting the individual’s ability to pursue and realise the\ngoals that he or she values; a rejection of the economic model of individuals acting to\nmaximise their self-interest heedless of relationships and emotions; an emphasis on the\ncomplementarities between various capabilities; and a recognition of human diversity,\nwhich draws attention to the role played by ethical principles in the design of the\n“good” society.\n• The third approach, developed within the economics tradition, is based on the notion of\nfair allocations. The basic idea, which is common to welfare economics, is that of\nweighting the various non-monetary dimensions of quality of life (beyond the goods\nand services that are traded in markets) in a way that respects people’s preferences. This\napproach requires choosing a particular reference point for each of the various non-\nmonetary dimensions, and obtaining information on people’s current situations and on\ntheir preferences with respect to these points. This approach avoids the pitfall of basing\nevaluations on an “average” willingness-to-pay that may disproportionately reflect the\npreferences of those who are better-off in society and focuses instead on equality among\nall of its members. \n68.\nThese approaches have obvious differences, but also certain similarities. For example,\nsubjective well-being is sometimes claimed to encompass all capabilities, in so far as these\nrefer to attributes and freedoms that people value (implying that enhancing their capabilities\nwill improve people’s subjective states). However, proponents of the capability approach also\nemphasise that subjective states are not the only things that matter, and that expanding\npeople’s opportunities is important in itself, even if this does not show up in greater subjective\nwell-being. Similarly, both the capability and the fair allocation approaches rely on\ninformation on the objective attributes of each person, while differing in the ways in which\nthese are weighted and aggregated. While the choice between these approaches is ultimately a\nnormative decision, they all point to the importance of a number of features that go beyond\ncommand over resources. Measuring these features requires the use of types of data (i.e.\nresponses to questionnaires and non-market observations of personal states) that are not\ncaptured by market transactions.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n43\n3 - Subjective measures of quality of life\n69.\nFor a long time, economists have assumed that it was sufficient to look at people’s\nchoices to derive information about their well-being, and that these choices would conform to\na standard set of assumptions. In recent years, however, much research has focused on what\npeople value and how they act in real life, and this has highlighted large discrepancies\nbetween standard assumptions of economic theory and real-world phenomena. A significant\npart of this research has been undertaken by psychologists and economists based on\nsubjective data on people’s reported or experienced well-being. \n70.\nSubjective measures have always been part of the traditional tool-kit of economists and\nstatisticians, as many features of our economies and societies are measured through people’s\nresponses to a standard set of questions (for example, “unemployment” is typically measured\nbased on people’s answers as to whether they worked at all in a specific reference week,\nwhether they actively looked for a job, and whether they would be available to start working\nin the near future). The specific feature of the subjective measures of quality of life discussed\nhere is that what people report about their own conditions has no obvious objective\ncounterpart: we can compare “perceived” and “actual” inflation, for example, but only\nrespondents can provide information on their own subjective states and values. Despite this\nfeature, a rich literature on these subjective measures concludes that they help to predict\npeople’s behaviour (e.g. workers who report more dissatisfaction in their work are more likely\nto quit their job), and that they are valid with respect to a range of other information (e.g.\npeople who report themselves as “happy” tend to smile more and to be rated as happy by\npeople around them; these self-reports are also correlated with electrical readings of the\nbrain).\n71.\nSubjective approaches distinguish between the dimensions of quality of life and the\nobjective factors shaping these dimensions. In turn, the subjective dimensions of quality of\nlife encompass several aspects. The first is represented by people’s evaluations of their life as\na whole or of its various domains, such as family, work and financial conditions. These\nevaluations imply a cognitive exercise by each person and an effort to take stock of and\nsummarise the full range of elements that people value (e.g. their sense of purpose, the\nfulfilment of their goals and how they are perceived by others). The second aspect is\nrepresented by people’s actual feelings, such as pain, worry and anger, or pleasure, pride and\nrespect. To the extent that these feelings are reported in real time, they are less affected by\nbiases due to memory and to social pressure related to what is deemed to be “good” in society.\nWithin this broad category of people’s feelings, the research on subjective well-being\ndistinguishes between positive and negative affects, as both characterise the experience of\neach person. \n72.\nAll these aspects of subjective well-being (cognitive evaluations, positive affects and\nnegative affects) should be measured separately to get a satisfactory appreciation of people’s\nlives. Which of these aspects matters more, and for what purpose, is still an open question.\nMuch evidence suggests that people act to achieve satisfaction in their choices, and that\nchoices are based on memories and evaluations. But memories and evaluations can also lead\nto bad choices, and some choices are made unconsciously rather than by weighing the pros\nand cons of various alternatives.\n73.\nSubjective reports of people’s life-evaluations and affects provide measures of quality\nof life that can be monitored over time; some of these measures can also be compared across\n\n44\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\ncountries in reliable ways. Probably more importantly, however, is that these measures\nprovide information about the determinants of quality of life at the level of each person.\nThese determinants include both features of the environment where people live and their\nindividual conditions, and they vary depending on the aspect considered. For example,\nactivities (such as commuting, working, or socialising) may be more important for affects,\nwhile conditions (such as being married, or having a rewarding job) may be more important\nfor life evaluations. In both cases, however, these measures provide information beyond that\nconveyed by income. For example, in most developed countries younger and older people\nreport higher evaluations of their life than prime-age people, a pattern that contrasts sharply\nwith levels of income for the same groups.\n74.\nOne area where various subjective measures of people’s well-being agree is in pointing\nto the high costs of unemployment for people’s quality of life. People who become\nunemployed report lower life-evaluations, even after controlling for their lower income, and\nwith little adaptation over time; unemployed people also report a higher prevalence of various\nnegative affects (sadness, stress and pain) and lower levels of positive ones (joy). These\nsubjective measures suggest that the costs of unemployment exceed the income-loss suffered\nby those who lose their jobs, reflecting the existence of non-pecuniary effects among the\nunemployed and of fears and anxieties generated by unemployment in the rest of society. \n75.\nWhile the initiatives of individual researchers and commercial data providers have led\nto important advances in the measurement of subjective well-being, the data remain limited in\nterms of the statistical inferences that they allow. National statistical systems need to build on\nthese efforts and incorporate questions about various aspects of subjective well-being in their\nstandard surveys. They should also develop longitudinal studies that could support more valid\ninferences about the relative importance of the various factors at work.\n4 - Objective features shaping quality of life\n76.\nBoth the capability and the fair allocation approaches give prominence to people’s\nobjective conditions and the opportunities available to them, while differing in how these\nfeatures are valued and ranked. While these objective features may also have an instrumental\nvalue for subjective well-being, both of these conceptual approaches regard an expansion of\npeople’s opportunities in these domains as intrinsically important for people’s lives. \n77.\nThe range of objective features to be considered in any assessment of quality of life will\ndepend on the purpose of the exercise: is the goal to assess changes in conditions within\nnational jurisdictions, or to compare these conditions across countries at different levels of\ndevelopment? Some features may matter as descriptors of people’s states (e.g. health), while\nothers may reflect the freedoms that people have to pursue the goals that they value (e.g.\npolitical voice). While the question of which elements should belong to a list of objective\nfeatures inevitably depend on value judgements, in practice most of these themes are shared\nacross countries and constituencies, and there is a large degree of consistency among the\nvarious exercises that focus on measuring “well-being” and related concepts.3 In general,\nmeasures for all these objective features highlight that how societies are organised makes a\n3.\nSee, for example, the Taxonomy developed by the OECD in the context of the “Global Project on Measuring\nthe Progress of Societies’ (www.oecd.org/progress/taxonomy).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n45\ndifference for people’s lives, and that their influences are not all captured by conventional\nmeasures of economic resources.\n4.1 - Health\n78.\nHealth is a basic feature shaping both the length and the quality of people’s lives. Its\nassessment requires good measures of both mortality and morbidity. Data gaps remain\nsignificant in both fields. Mortality statistics by age and gender document the risk of death\nconfronting people and are used to calculate the expected length of a person’s life. These\nindicators are today available in all developed countries but remain limited in large parts of\nthe developing world, in particular for adults, which limits the possibility of monitoring\nprogress in achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals. Further, age-specific mortality\nstatistics are vectors: to obtain a scalar measure of people’s lifespan, they need to be\naggregated in suitable ways and standardised for differences in age-structure across countries\nand over time. While different aggregation formulas and standardisation methods exist, they\nlead to different results and rankings when comparing countries with survival curves (by age)\nthat cross each other. This suggests that a variety of mortality measures should be compiled\nand regularly monitored. Nonetheless, it is significant that non-monetary measures of\npeople’s health can diverge significantly from conventional economic measures. For example,\nalthough France has a lower GDP per capita than the United States, its life-expectancy at birth\nis higher, and this advantage has been widening (from less than 6 months in 1960 to almost\n2 years in 2006) even while its GDP per capita relative to the US was falling (Figure 2.1).\nFigure 2.1. Gaps in GDP per capita and life expectancy at birth between the United States \nand France\n \nNote: Ratios of French values to US values (values greater than 1 indicate better conditions in France than in the US).\nFor example, in 2006 French GDP per capita was 0.82 of the US level, while the life expectancy of French men was\n1.025 times that of men in the United States.\nSource: OECD data.\n0.98\n0.99\n1.00\n1.01\n1.02\n1.03\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\nGDP per head, current prices and PPPs (left‐hand axis)\nLife expectancy at birth, males (right‐hand axis)\n\n46\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n79.\nThe state of progress is far more limited for statistics on morbidity, a situation that has\nled to long-standing disagreements about whether declines in mortality have been matched by\nsimilar declines in morbidity. Existing measures of morbidity rest on a variety of sources:\nrecords of people’s height and weight; diagnoses by health professionals; registers for specific\ndiseases; and self-reports drawn for censuses and surveys. Some of these measures relate to\nthe prevalence of diseases or injuries, while others refer to their consequences in terms of the\nfunctioning of the person affected (which also depends on the quality of treatment). Variations\nin the measures and underlying data are inevitable given the many manifestations of poor\nhealth, but this also poses a real obstacle to comparing countries and monitoring changes in\npeople’s morbidity over time. Measures are even sparser when moving from physical to\nmental disorders, despite evidence that these affect (at least in mild forms) a large share of\npeople, that most of these disorders go untreated, and that their incidence has been increasing\nin some countries. \n80.\nThe variety of dimensions of people’s health has led to several attempts to define a\nsummary measure that combines both mortality and morbidity. However, although several\ncombined indices of people’s health exist, none currently commands universal agreement.\nFurther, they all inevitably rest on ethical judgements that are controversial, and on weights\nfor various medical conditions whose legitimacy is not always clear. \n81.\nThe challenges posed by this variety of health measures are not confined to cross-\ncountry comparisons but extend to within-country comparisons. Recent research on\ninequalities in health status has highlighted several patterns. First, people from lower\noccupational classes who have less education and income tend to die at younger ages and to\nsuffer, within their shorter lifetimes, a higher prevalence of various health problems. Second,\nthese differences in health conditions do not merely reflect worse outcomes for people at the\nvery bottom of the socio-economic scale but extend to people throughout the socio-economic\nhierarchy, i.e. they display a “social gradient”: for example, life expectancy in the United\nKingdom increases when moving from unskilled manual workers to skilled ones, from\nmanual to non-manual workers, from lower-ranked office workers to higher-ranked staff.\nWhile these patterns in health inequalities have an obvious relevance for assessing quality of\nlife, existing measures do not allow cross-country comparisons of their magnitude, due to\ndifferences in the measures of health outcomes used, in the individual characteristics\nconsidered (education, income, ethnicity), and in the reference population and geographic\ncoverage of the various national studies.4\n4.2 - Education\n82.\nA long tradition of economic research has stressed the importance of education in\nproviding the skills and competencies that underpin economic production. But education\nmatters for quality of life independently of its effects on people’s earnings and productivity.\nEducation is strongly associated with people’s life-evaluations, even after controlling for the\nhigher income it brings. Further, better-educated people typically have better health status,\nlower unemployment, more social connections, and greater engagement in civic and political\nlife. While the available evidence does not always allow conclusions about the directionality\n4.\nNote however that there is ongoing research to measure socio-economic inequalities to health in a standard\nway, see for example the European Union Working Group in Socio-economic Inequalities to Health.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n47\nof causation between education and these other dimensions of quality of life (e.g. less healthy\nchildren may miss school more often), there is a consensus that education brings a range of\nreturns (monetary and non-monetary) that benefit both the person investing in the education\nand the community in which they live. Measuring the size of these wider benefits of education\nis an important research priority, where progress requires better measures of people’s\ncharacteristics in a range of domains and surveys that follow the same individual over time.\n83.\nAvailable educational indicators cover a broad range of fields. Some refer to inputs (e.g.\nschool enrolment, educational expenditures and school resources), while others refer to\nthroughputs and outputs (e.g. graduation rates, completed years of schooling, standardized\ntest-measures of people’s achievements in terms of literacy and numeracy). Which of these\nindicators is more relevant depends on the stage of a country’s development and on the goal\nof the evaluation exercise. The available indicators highlight large differences across\ncountries, with various educational indicators sometimes highlighting contrasting patterns.\nSome countries, for example, may combine excellence for students that reach university\neducation with widespread under-achievement for a large number of youth, mainly from\nhouseholds at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. These differences would cancel out in\nsummary measures of education (e.g. mean years of schooling) but have significance for any\nassessment of quality of life. Within countries, measures of inequality in learning outcomes\nare especially important for youth at the bottom of the achievement scale who are at risk of\npoverty or exclusion from well-paid and rewarding jobs in adult life. As education is an\nimportant predictor of many dimensions of people’s lives, all social surveys should\nsystematically include information on the learning experiences of respondents and of their\nparents, as well as information on other features shaping the quality of their lives.\n84.\nSome of the most relevant indicators for assessing the effect of education on quality of\nlife are measures of people’s competencies. Several tools have been developed in recent years\nto measure these in standardised ways, though the tools still have significant limitations. First,\nand most obviously, not all countries currently implement these surveys. Second, many of\nthese tools were not developed from the perspective of measuring people’s capabilities in a\nbroad sense, but for the purpose of assessing educational policies, which typically required\nfocusing on a more narrow set of measurable competencies. Third, existing assessment tools\noften have a narrow coverage, as schooling is only one of the inputs that lead to knowledge,\nskills development and improvements in quality of life. Information about the experiences\nand “soft” competencies acquired by children in their early years remains limited, despite\nincreasing evidence that early-childhood experiences matter for people’s learning and quality\nof life in later years. Measurement tools also remain limited when it comes to comparing the\ncompetencies of students in higher education and to assessing workers’ experiences in terms\nof adult education and training (although this will change as new surveys of adult\ncompetencies are developed and implemented). As for other features of quality of life, the\nmain problem for indicators in this domain is not the lack of detailed information on\neducation per se, but rather the lack of surveys measuring both education and other outcomes\nthat matter for quality of life at the individual level.\n4.3 - Personal activities\n85.\nHow people spend their time and the nature of their personal activities matters for\nquality of life, irrespectively of the income generated. The activities that people engage in\nhave effects on their subjective well-being, in terms of both their hedonic experiences\n\n48\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n(Figure 2.2) and their evaluative judgements. More generally, people do not always “choose”\namong these activities in the same way as they allocate their budget among various goods,\ndue to a lack of effective alternatives. Further, these choices will generally affect other people\nwithin the family and community, with some of these personal activities effectively\nrepresenting indirect costs to production (e.g. commuting) rather than consumption. \nFigure 2.2. Ranking of personal activities based on women’s hedonic experiences and time \ndevoted to them in selected cities in the United States and France\nActivities ranked in decreasing order of enjoyment in the United States\nNote: The ranking of activities is based on information on the proportion of 15-minute intervals in which the hedonic experience\nof “stress”, “sadness” or “pain” exceeded that of “happiness”. Data refer to a sample of women in Columbus (Ohio, United\nStates) and Rennes (France), interviewed in 2006 with the Princeton Affect and Time Survey. \nSource: Krueger, A.B., D. Kahneman, D.

Housing, although not representing an activity per\nse, was also discussed because it provides the setting for a number of personal activities.\n• Paid work matters for quality of life partly because it provides identity to people and\nopportunities to socialise with others. However, not all jobs are equally valuable in this\nrespect. This underscores the importance of collecting more systematic information on\nthe quality of paid work, as a number of international organisations have been doing in\nthe context of their ongoing studies of “decent work”. Some national surveys provide\ninformation on many aspects of decent work, such as non-standard employment, gender\ngaps in employment and wages, discrimination in the workplace, opportunities for\nlifelong learning, access to employment for disabled persons, working time and\n“unsocial hours”, the work-life balance, work accidents and physical risks, work\nintensity, social dialogue and workers’ autonomy. Their practical use is, however,\nlimited by small sample sizes and survey differences across countries. \n• Unpaid domestic work, such as shopping and the care of children and other household\nmembers, is important from the perspective of assessing both the total amount of\nhousehold services produced and how family chores are distributed between men and\nwomen. \n• Commuting time is also key to the quality of work, and monitoring it requires\ninformation on the number of hours spent travelling to and from work during a specified\nperiod, as well as on the accessibility and affordability of transport. \n• A long tradition of research has emphasised the importance of leisure-time for quality of\nlife. This research points to the importance of developing indicators of both leisure\nquantity (number of hours) and quality (number of episodes, where they took place,\npresence of other people), as well as of measures of participation in cultural events and\nof “poor leisure” (such as the share of children who did not take a holiday away from\nhome in the previous year). \n• Finally, despite the importance of housing for a variety of social outcomes (such as\nchildren’s education), no core set of housing indicators currently exists for international\ncomparisons. Remedying this situation would require better information on the number\nof people who are homeless or living in emergency shelters and on housing quality (e.g.\nin terms of the local services available and overcrowding).\n87.\nIn several cases, suitable indicators in these various fields already exist, and the\nchallenge is to improve upon what has been achieved in the past. In other areas, however,\nexisting measures remain seriously deficient, and progress requires investment in new\nstatistical capacity. A case in point, cutting across all the personal activities described above,\nis that of measuring how people spend their time. Time is the natural metric for comparing\npersonal activities and (as argued in Chapter 1) an essential input to the construction of\nsatellite household accounts. One priority should be to develop measurement tools grounded\non clear definitions and based on surveys with a consistent design that are representative of\npatterns over a full year and are undertaken with sufficient regularity – all requirements that\nare rarely met. Ideally, these surveys should cover both the amount of time spent in various\nactivities and the feelings that they produce. This is important, as the same activity can\n\n50\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\ngenerate different hedonic experiences depending on people’s own conditions (e.g. whether\nthey are unemployed or not); this information also matters for assessing inequalities between\ndifferent groups in society (e.g. by gender). While these investments in statistical capacity are\ncostly, and compete with other priorities, their pay-off for quality-of-life research is\npotentially huge. \n4.4 - Political voice and governance\n88.\nPolitical voice is an integral dimension of the quality of life. Intrinsically, the ability to\nparticipate as full citizens, to have a say in the framing of policies, to dissent without fear and\nto speak up against what one perceives to be wrong are essential freedoms. Instrumentally,\npolitical voice can provide a corrective to public policy: it can ensure the accountability of\nofficials and public institutions, reveal what people need and value, and call attention to\nsignificant deprivations. Political voice also reduces the potential for conflicts and enhances\nthe prospect of building consensus on key issues, with pay-offs for economic efficiency,\nsocial equity, and inclusiveness in public life. \n89.\nThe opportunities for political voice and the degree of responsiveness of the political\nsystem depend on the institutional features of each country, such as the presence of a\nfunctioning democracy, universal suffrage, free media, and civil society organisations. This\nalso depends on some key aspects of governance, such as legislative guarantees and the rule\nof law. Legislative guarantees include both constitutional rights and rights provided by\ngeneral laws that enhance the quality of life of all residents and that reflect the social\nconsensus prevailing in different countries and times. The structure of laws can also affect the\ninvestment climate in a country and thus have an impact on market functioning, economic\ngrowth, job creation and material welfare. However, to realise their potential, legal guarantees\nrequire effective implementation and substantive justice, which depend on how various\ninstitutions (e.g. the police, the judiciary and various administrative services) function,\nwhether they are free from corruption, political interference and social prejudice, and whether\nthey can be held accountable for their decisions.\n90.\nComparisons based on existing indicators of political voice and governance highlight\nvast differences between countries, especially between those with a long history of\ndemocratic functioning and those that have moved from authoritarian to democratic regimes\nonly more recently and that have not yet established the full range of freedoms and rights.\nEven in the developed world, however, low trust in public institutions and declining political\nparticipation point to a growing gap between how citizens and political elites perceive the\nfunctioning of democratic institutions. There are also systematic differences in how different\ngroups exercise political voice, and with respect to fundamental rights and opportunities for\ncivic participation in these countries, especially between citizens and the growing numbers of\nimmigrants.\n91.\nIndicators of political voice and governance should help to evaluate the functioning of\nmultiparty democracy and universal suffrage, the level of participation in government\ndecisions at the local level, and the presence of a free media and various freedoms (e.g. to\nform and join civil organizations, trade unions and professional bodies, or to participate in\ncivic and social activities). Relevant indicators should cover the rights embedded in\nconstitutions, laws (e.g. that promote civil and criminal justice, equality, inclusion,\naccountability and affirmative action), international covenants on human rights and basic\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n51\nfreedoms, as well as the functioning of the judicial system (e.g. its independence from\ncorruption and political influences, the speed with which it delivers justice, and its\naccessibility to both citizens and residents). Many of these indicators are typically compiled\nby bodies outside the boundaries of national statistical systems and are based mainly on the\nopinion of experts. These indicators need to be complemented, and in some cases replaced, by\nsurveys of citizens’ own perceptions of how well the political, legal and executive institutions\nare functioning, the difficulties they face in accessing them, and the trust that they place in\nthem. Such surveys also need to capture inequalities in access to these institutions across\nsocio-economic groups.\n4.5 - Social connections\n92.\nSocial connections improve quality of life in a variety of ways. People with more social\nconnections report higher life-evaluations, as many of the most pleasurable personal activities\ninvolve socialising. The benefits of social connections extend to people’s health and to the\nprobability of finding a job, as well as to several characteristics of the neighbourhood where\npeople live (e.g. the prevalence of crime and the performance of local schools). These social\nconnections are sometimes described as “social capital” to highlight the benefits (direct and\nindirect) that they bring. As with other types of capital, the externalities stemming from social\ncapital can sometimes be negative: for example, belonging to a group may strengthen a sense\nof unique personal identity that fuels a climate of violence and confrontation with other\ngroups. This, however, underscores the importance of better analysing the nature of these\nsocial connections and the breadth of their effects, rather than underestimating their\nsignificance. The available evidence suggests that social connections benefit people in the\nnetworks, with effects on non-participants that depend on both the nature of the group and the\neffects being considered.\n93.\nThe drivers of change in people’s social connections are not always well understood.\nSocial connections provide services to people (e.g. insurance, security), and the development\nof both markets and government programmes may have reduced the ties of individuals with\ntheir community thanks to the provision of alternative arrangements. What is clear is that a\ndecline in these ties may negatively affect people’s lives, even when their functions are taken\nup by market or government alternatives that increase the level of economic activity (such as\nwhen the informal surveillance of neighbours is replaced by salaried security guards). To\navoid a biased assessment of human well-being, measures of these social connections are\ntherefore needed.\n94.\nResearch on social connections has traditionally relied on proxy measures, such as the\nnumber of individual memberships in associations, or the frequency of activities assumed to\nresult from social connections (e.g. altruistic behaviour and voter turn-out). However, it is by\nnow accepted that these are not good measures of social connections, and that reliable\nmeasures require surveys of peoples’ behaviours and activities. In recent years, a number of\nstatistical offices (in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands and,\nmost recently, the United States) have started surveys that measure various forms of social\nconnections. For example, special modules of the labour-force survey in the United States ask\npeople about their civic and political engagement, their membership and voluntary work in\nvarious organisations, their relationship with neighbours and family members, and how they\nget information and news. Similar surveys should be implemented elsewhere, based on\nquestions and protocols that allow valid comparisons across countries and over time. Progress\n\n52\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nshould also be made in measuring additional dimensions of social connections (such as trust\nin others, social isolation, availability of informal support in case of need, engagement in the\nworkplace and in religious activities, friendship across lines of race, religion and social class)\nby building on the experience accumulated by some countries in these fields. \n4.6 - Environmental conditions\n95.\nEnvironmental conditions are important not only for sustainability, but also because of\ntheir immediate impact on the quality of people’s lives. First, they affect human health both\ndirectly (through air and water pollution, hazardous substances and noise) and indirectly\n(through climate change, transformations in the carbon and water cycles, biodiversity loss and\nnatural disasters that affect the health of ecosystems). Secondly, people benefit from\nenvironmental services, such as access to clean water and recreation areas, and their rights in\nthis field (including rights to access environmental information) have been increasingly\nrecognized. Third, people value environmental amenities or disamenities, and these\nvaluations affect their actual choices (e.g. of where to live). Lastly, environmental conditions\nmay lead to climatic variations and natural disasters, such as drought and flooding, which\ndamage both the properties and the lives of the affected populations.\n96.\nMeasuring the effects of environmental conditions on people’s lives is, however,\ncomplex. These effects manifest themselves over different timescales, and their impacts vary\ndepending on people’s characteristics (e.g. where they live and work, their metabolic intake).\nFurther, the strength of these relations is often underestimated because of limits in current\nscientific understanding and in the extent to which various environmental factors have been\nsubject to systemic investigations.\n97.\nMuch progress has been achieved in the last two decades in terms of measuring\nenvironmental conditions (through better environmental data, the regular monitoring of\nindicators, and accounting tools), understanding their impacts (e.g. evaluation of related\nmorbidity and mortality, labour productivity, the economic stakes associated with climate\nchange, biodiversity change, damage from disasters) and establishing a right of access to\nenvironmental information. A range of environmental indicators can be used to measure\nhuman pressure on the environment, the responses from administrations, firms and\nhouseholds to environmental degradation, and the actual state of environmental quality.\n98.\nHowever, from a quality-of-life perspective, existing indicators remain limited in\nimportant respects. For example, emissions indicators refer mainly to the aggregate quantities\nof various pollutants, rather than to the share of people exposed to dangerous doses. Existing\nindicators should hence be supplemented in a number of ways, including the regular\nmonitoring of the number of premature deaths from exposure to air pollution; the number of\npeople who lack access to water services and nature, or who are exposed to dangerous levels\nof noise and pollution; and the damage inflicted by environmental disasters. Survey measures\nof people’s own feelings and evaluations of the environmental conditions of their\nneighbourhood are also needed. Because many of the effects of environmental conditions on\nquality of life differ across people, these indicators should refer to people grouped according\nto various classification criteria.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n53\n4.7 - Personal insecurity\n99.\nPersonal insecurity includes external factors that put at risk the physical integrity of\neach person: crime, accidents, natural disasters, and climate changes are some of the most\nobvious factors.5 In extreme cases, these factors can lead to the death of the person involved.\nWhile these elements account for only a minority of all deaths, and they are captured by\ngeneral mortality statistics, one rationale for having specific measures of their frequency is\nthat their effect on people’s emotional lives is very different than that of deaths related to\nmedical conditions, as shown by the large impact of bereavement on people’s subjective well-\nbeing.\n100. Less extreme manifestations of personal insecurity such as crime affect quality of life\nfor a significantly larger number of people, with even larger numbers reporting fear of being a\nvictim of a physical aggression. One of the most remarkable feature of reports on subjective\nfear of crime is how little they are related to experienced victimisation: countries with a\nhigher share of people reporting fear of crime do not experience a higher victimisation while,\nwithin countries, older and richer people feel more unsafe than younger and poorer people,\ndespite being less likely to be a victim of crime. \n101. These patterns highlight the importance of developing more regular and reliable\nmeasures of personal security to orient public discussion. Victimisation surveys are an\nessential tool to assess the frequency of crime and the fear it generates. Other tools need to be\nmobilised to assess other threats to personal security, such as domestic violence and violence\nin countries ravaged by conflict and war.\n4.8 - Economic insecurity\n102. Uncertainty about the material conditions that may prevail in the future reflects the\nexistence of a variety of risks, in particular for unemployment, illness, and old age. The\nrealisation of these risks has negative consequences for the quality of life, depending on the\nseverity of the shock, its duration, the stigma associated with it, the risk aversion of each\nperson, and the financial implications. \n103. Job loss can lead to economic insecurity when unemployment is recurrent or persistent,\nwhen unemployment benefits are low relative to previous earnings, or when workers have to\naccept major cuts in pay, hours or both to find a new job. The consequences of job insecurity\nare both immediate (as replacement income is typically lower than the earnings on the\nprevious job) and longer term (due to potential losses in wages when the person does find\nanother job). While indicators of these consequences are available, cross-country\ncomparisons are difficult, requiring special investments in this direction. Job insecurity can\nalso be measured by asking workers either to evaluate the security of their present job or to\nrate their expectation of losing their job in the near future. The fear of job loss can have\nnegative consequences for the quality of life of the workers (e.g. physical and mental illness,\ntensions in family life) as well as for firms (e.g. adverse impacts on workers’ motivation and\nproductivity, lower identification with corporate objectives) and society as a whole. \n5.\nEnvironmental insecurity is not developed here since this issue is already considered above.\n\n54\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n104. Illness can cause economic insecurity both directly and indirectly. For people with no\n(or only partial) health insurance, medical costs can be devastating, forcing them into debt, to\nsell their home and assets, or to forego treatment at the cost of worse health outcomes in the\nfuture. One indicator of illness-related economic insecurity is provided by the share of people\nwithout health insurance. However, health insurance can cover different contingencies, and\neven insured people may incur high out-of-pocket health expenses in the event of illness. To\nthese out-of-pocket health expenses should be added the loss of income that occurs if the\nperson has to stop working and the health (or other) insurance does not provide replacement\nincome.\n105. Old age is not a risk per se, but it can still imply economic insecurity due to uncertainty\nabout needs and resources after withdrawal from the labour market. Two types of risk, in\nparticular, are important. The first is the risk of inadequate resources during retirement, due to\ninsufficient future pension payments or to greater needs associated with illness or disability.\nThe second is the risk of volatility in pension payments: while all retirement-income systems\nare exposed to some types of risk, the greater role of the private sector in financing old-age\npensions (in the form of both occupational pensions and personal savings) has made it\npossible to extend the coverage of pension systems in many countries but at the cost of\nshifting risk from governments and firms towards individuals, thereby increasing their\ninsecurity. \n106. The many factors shaping economic insecurity are reflected in the variety of approaches\nused to measure them. Some approaches try to quantify the frequency of specific risks, while\nothers look at the consequences of a risk that materialises and at the means available to people\nto protect themselves from these risks (especially resources provided by social security\nprogrammes). A comprehensive measure of economic insecurity would ideally account for\nboth the frequency of each risk and its consequences, and some attempts in this direction have\nbeen made. A further problem is that of aggregating across the various risks that shape\neconomic insecurity, as the indicators that describe these risks lack a common metric to assess\ntheir severity. A final, even more intractable problem is that of accounting for the long-term\nconsequences for quality of life of the various policies used to limit economic insecurity\n(through their effects on unemployment and labour-force participation).\n5 - Cross-cutting issues\n107. Most of the measurement challenges described above are specific to each dimension of\nquality of life, and the Commission has only hinted at some of the work required, leaving it to\nagencies with expertise in each field to detail concrete action plans. Other challenges,\nhowever, are cross-cutting and are unlikely to be picked up through initiatives undertaken\nseparately in each field.6 Three of these issues deserve special attention.\n5.1 - Inequalities in quality of life\n108. The first cross-cutting challenge for quality-of-life indicators is to detail the inequalities\nin individual conditions in the various dimensions of life, rather than just the average\n6.\nWhile insecurity is dealt with as an objective factor shaping quality of life, it can also be considered as a\ncross-cutting issue because of the large variety of risks the individuals are exposed to. The placement of insecurity\namong the objective factors has been debated at some length and is conventional.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n55\nconditions in each country. To some extent, the failure to account for these inequalities\nexplains the “growing gap” – identified by the French Presidency when establishing the\nCommission – between the aggregate statistics that dominate policy discussions and people’s\nsentiments about their own conditions. \n109. While established methodologies and data sources can be used to measure inequalities\nin the distribution of economic resources in a fairly reliable way, the situation is much less\nsatisfactory with respect to the non-monetary dimensions of quality of life. This is especially\ntrue given that these inequalities cannot always be described through information on the size\nof the distribution of these features around their mean. For example, differences in the\nlifespan of people may reflect genetic differences that are randomly distributed in the\npopulation: in these circumstances, narrowing the overall distribution of life duration would\nnot make society less “unequal” in any morally compelling way. \n110. The problems, however, go deeper than developing suitable measures. There are many\ninequalities, and each is significant in itself: this suggests that we should avoid the\npresumption that one of them (e.g. income) will always encompass all others. At the same\ntime, certain inequalities may be mutually reinforcing. Gender disparities, for example, while\npervasive in most countries and groups, are typically much larger for households with lower\nsocio-economic status: in many developing countries, the combined effect of gender and\nsocio-economic status is often to exclude young women in poor households from attending\nschool and getting rewarding jobs, denying them possibilities of self-expression and political\nvoice, and exposing them to hazards that put their health at risk. The measurement of some of\nthese inequalities (such as those related to class and socio-economic status) has contributed,\nover the years, to a wide array of policies and institutions aimed at reducing their intensity and\nconsequences. Other types of inequality, such as between ethnic groups, are more recent (at\nleast in countries that have experienced large waves of immigration) and are set to become\nmore politically salient in the future as immigration continues. \n111. It is critical that these inequalities be assessed in a comprehensive way, by looking at\ndifferences in quality of life across people, groups and generations. Further, as people can be\nclassified according to different criteria, each with some relevance for people’s lives,\ninequalities should be measured and documented for a plurality of groups. Appropriate\nsurveys should be developed to assess the complementarities between the various types of\ninequality and to identify their underlying causes. It is up to the statistical community to\nregularly feed these analyses with suitable data.\n5.2 - Assessing links across quality-of-life dimensions\n112. The second cross-cutting challenge, already alluded to above, is to better assess the\nrelationship between the various dimensions of quality of life. Some of the most important\npolicy questions involved relate to how developments in one area (e.g. education) affect\ndevelopments in others (e.g. health status, political voice and social connections), and how\ndevelopments in all fields are related to those in income. While some of these relationships, in\nparticular at the individual level, are poorly measured and inadequately understood, ignoring\nthe cumulative effects of multiple disadvantages leads to sub-optimal policies. For example,\nthe loss of quality of life due to being both poor and sick far exceeds the sum of the two\nseparate effects, implying that governments may need to target their interventions more\nspecifically at those who cumulate these disadvantages. \n\n56\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n113. Assessing these links across the various dimensions of quality of life is not easy, as\nstatistical systems continue to be highly segmented across disciplines, with measurement\ninstruments in each field paying only scant attention to developments in other domains. But\nprogress can be achieved by developing information about the “joint distribution” of the most\nsalient features of quality of life (such as hedonic experiences, health status, education,\npolitical voice) across all people. While the full development of this information could be\nachieved only in the distant future, concrete steps in this direction could be accomplished by\nincluding in all surveys a few standard questions that allow classifying respondents based on\na limited set of characteristics, and that describe their conditions in a broad range of fields.\nInvestment should also be made in developing longitudinal surveys that could allow both\ncontrolling for people’s personal characteristics and better analysing the directionality of\ncausation between the different factors shaping life.\n5.3 - Aggregating across quality- of-life dimensions\n114. The third cross-cutting challenge to quality-of-life research is to aggregate the rich\narray of measures in a parsimonious way. The issue of aggregation is both specific to each\nfeature of quality of life (as in the case of measures that combine mortality and morbidity in\nthe health field) and more general, requiring the valuation and aggregation of the\nachievements in various domains of life, both for each person and for society as a whole. The\nsearch for a scalar measure of quality of life is often perceived as the single most important\nchallenge faced by quality-of-life research. While this emphasis is partly misplaced – the\ninformational content of any aggregate index will always reflect the quality of the measures\nused in its construction – the demands in this field are strong, and statistical offices should\nplay a role in answering them. \n115. Traditionally, the most common response to this demand for parsimony in quality-of-\nlife research has been to aggregate a number of indicators (suitably selected and scaled) of\naverage performance in various fields at the country-level. The best known example of this\napproach is the Human Development Index. This measure has played (and continues to play)\nan important communication role, leading to country-rankings that differ significantly from\nthose based on per-capita GDP, especially for some less-developed countries. However, the\nchoices on the weights used to construct this (and other similar) indexes reflect value\njudgements that have controversial implications: for example, adding the logarithm of per-\ncapita GDP to the level of life expectancy (as done by the Human Development Index)\nimplicitly values an additional year of life expectancy in the United States as worth 20 times\nan additional year of life in India. More fundamentally, being based on country-averages,\nthese measures ignore the significant correlations between the various features of quality of\nlife across people, and do not say anything about the distribution of these individual\nconditions within each country. For example, the scalar index will not change if average\nperformance in each domain remains the same while the accumulation of advantages or\ndisadvantages for the same person across various domains of life changes over time.\n116. Several aggregate measures of quality of life are possible, depending on the\nphilosophical perspective taken and the question addressed. Some of these measures are\nalready being used sporadically (e.g. average levels of life-satisfaction for a country as a\nwhole, and composite indices such as the Human Development Index, which is mainly\nfocused on developing countries) and could be extended through questionnaire-based\nmeasures of people’s psychological health, feelings and evaluations and through\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n57\nconsideration of additional dimensions of quality of life. Others could be implemented if\nnational statistical systems made the necessary investment to provide the type of data needed\nto allow their computation. For example, the U-index, i.e. the proportion of one’s time in\nwhich the strongest reported feeling is a negative one (see Figure 2), requires collecting\ninformation on emotional experiences during specific episodes through time-use surveys.\nSimilarly, methods based on counting the occurrences and severity of various objective\nfeatures for each person (which is linked to the capability approach), before proceeding to\nconstruct country-averages, require information on the joint distribution of various objective\nfeatures. Finally, the notion of “equivalent income” (which is linked to the fair allocations\napproach) requires information on people’s states in various dimensions of quality of life, and\non their preferences with respect to these states (for a given reference level in each). \n117. In general, different approaches will lead to distinct scalar measures of quality of life for\neach country, and to different characteristics of the people classified as “worse-off”. For\nexample, in a sample of Russian respondents, people in the bottom quintile of the distribution\nof equivalent income report worse health and a higher incidence of unemployment compared\nto people identified as “worse-off” based on either their consumption expenditure or their\nsubjective life-evaluations (Figure 2.3). This suggests that, rather than focusing on\nconstructing a single summary measure of quality of life, statistical systems should provide\nthe data required for computing various aggregate measures according to the philosophic\nperspective of each user.\nFigure 2.3. Characteristics of the most deprived people according to different measures \nof quality of life, Russia in 2000 \nNote. Data refer to people considered as “worse-off” (i.e. in the bottom quintile of the distribution) according to three\ndifferent measures of their quality of life: i) household consumption expenditure (adjusted for the number of people in\neach household); ii) life-satisfaction (based on the question, “To what extent are you satisfied with your life in general at\nthe present time?” with answers on a five-point scale); and iii) a measure of equivalent income, based on four\n“functionings”, i.e. self-reported health, employment status, quality of housing, and having incurred wage arrears. For\neach of these three measures of quality of life, the figure plots the average levels of various factors shaping quality of\nlife among the “worse-off” based on one measure relative to those based on all others. \nSource: Fleurbaey M., E.

Quality of life includes the full range of factors that make life worth living, including\nthose that are not traded in markets and not captured by monetary measures. While some\nextensions of economic accounting include some additional elements that shape quality of life\nin conventional money-based measures of economic well-being, there are limits on how much\nthis approach can achieve. Other indicators have an important role to play in measuring social\nprogress, and recent advances in research have led to new and credible measures for at least\nsome aspects of quality of life. These measures, while not replacing conventional economic\nindicators, provide an opportunity to enrich policy discussions and to inform people’s view of\nthe conditions of the communities in which they live; today, they have the potential to move\nfrom research to standard statistical practice. The Commission’s recommendations in this\nfield can be summarised as follows:\nRecommendation 1: Measures of subjective well-being provide key information about\npeople’s quality of life. Statistical offices should incorporate questions to capture people’s life\nevaluations, hedonic experiences and priorities in their own surveys. \n119. Research has shown that it is possible to collect meaningful and reliable data on\nsubjective well-being. Subjective well-being encompasses different aspects (cognitive\nevaluations of one’s life, positive emotions such as joy and pride, and negative emotions such\nas pain and worry): each of them should be measured separately to derive a more\ncomprehensive appreciation of people’s lives. Quantitative measures of these subjective\naspects hold the promise of delivering not just a good measure of quality of life per se, but\nalso a better understanding of its determinants, reaching beyond people’s income and material\nconditions. Despite the persistence of many unresolved issues, these subjective measures\nprovide important information about quality of life. Because of this, the types of question that\nhave proved their value within small-scale, unofficial surveys should be included in larger-\nscale surveys undertaken by official statistical offices.\nRecommendation 2: Quality of life also depends on people’s objective conditions and\nopportunities. Steps should be taken to improve measures of people’s health, education,\npersonal activities, political voice, social connections, environmental conditions and\ninsecurity. \n120. The information relevant to valuing quality of life goes beyond people’s self-reports and\nperceptions to include measures of their functionings and freedoms. While the precise list of\nthese features inevitably rests on value judgments, there is a consensus that quality of life\ndepends on people’s health and education, their everyday activities (which include the right to\na decent job and housing), their participation in the political process, the social and natural\nenvironment in which they live, and the factors shaping their personal and economic security.\nMeasuring all these features requires both objective and subjective data. The challenge in all\nthese fields is to improve upon what has already been achieved, to identify gaps in available\ninformation, and to invest in statistical capacity in areas (such as time-use) where available\nindicators remain deficient. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n59\nRecommendation 3: Quality-of-life indicators in all the dimensions they cover should assess\ninequalities in a comprehensive way.\n121. Inequalities in human conditions are integral to any assessment of quality of life across\ncountries and the way that it is developing over time. Each dimension of quality-of-life\nrequires appropriate measures of inequality, with each of these measures being significant in\nitself and none claiming absolute priority over others. Inequalities should be assessed across\npeople, socio-economic groups and generations, with special attention to inequalities that\nhave arisen more recently, such as those linked to immigration. \nRecommendation 4: Surveys should be designed to assess the links between various quality-\nof-life domains for each person, and this information should be used when designing policies \nin various fields.\n122. It is critical to address questions about how developments in one domain of quality of\nlife affect other domains, and how developments in all the various fields are related to\nincome. This is important because the consequences for quality of life of having multiple\ndisadvantages far exceed the sum of their individual effects. Developing measures of these\ncumulative effects requires information on the “joint distribution” of the most salient features\nof quality of life across everyone in a country through dedicated surveys. Steps in this\ndirection could also be taken by including in all surveys some standard questions that allow\nclassifying respondents based on a limited set of characteristics. When designing policies in\nspecific fields, indicators pertaining to different quality-of-life dimensions should be\nconsidered jointly, to address the interactions between dimensions and the needs of people\nwho are disadvantaged in several domains.\nRecommendation 5: Statistical offices should provide the information needed to aggregate\nacross quality-of-life dimensions, allowing the construction of different scalar indexes.\n123. While assessing quality-of-life requires a plurality of indicators, there are strong\ndemands to develop a single scalar measure. Several scalar measures of quality of life are\npossible, depending on the question addressed and the approach taken. Some of these\nmeasures are already being used, such as average levels of life-satisfaction for a country as a\nwhole, or composite indices that aggregate averages across domains, such as the Human\nDevelopment Index. Others could be implemented if national statistical systems made the\nnecessary investment to provide the data required for their computation. These include\nmeasures of the proportion of one’s time in which the strongest reported feeling is a negative\none, measures based on counting the occurrence and severity of various objective features of\npeople’s lives, and (equivalent-income) measures based on people’s states and preferences.\n\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\nCHAPTER 3 - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT \nAND ENVIRONMENT 7\n1. Introduction\n124. The first two chapters have dealt extensively with the measurement of current well-\nbeing, either along dimensions that can be summed up in monetary units (Chapter 1), or along\ndimensions that are less amenable to conversion into monetary units (Chapter 2).\n125. The sustainability issue that is raised by this last chapter is of a different nature.\nSustainability poses the challenge of determining whether we can hope to see the current level\nof well-being at least maintained for future periods or future generations, or whether the most\nlikely scenario is that it will decline. It is no longer a question of measuring the present, but of\npredicting the future, and this prospective dimension multiplies the difficulties already\nencountered in the first two chapters. \n126. Despite these difficulties, many proposals have been made for measuring sustainability\nin quantitative terms, stemming from seminal work such as Nordhaus and Tobin’s\n“Sustainable measure of economic welfare” in the 1970s, or following the strong impulse\ngiven by the Brundtland Report in 1987 and the Rio Summit at the turn of the 1990s. The\npresent chapter will start with a short review of these proposals. We shall see that many of\nthem fail to distinguish clearly between the measurement of current well-being and the\nassessment of its sustainability. To put it very simply, many proposals try to cover all three\ndimensions examined by the three subgroups of the Commission, and sometimes try to sum\nthem up in a single number. This is not the way the Commission has structured its approach,\nand with good reason. We firmly believe that sustainability deserves separate measurement,\nand we shall focus in this chapter on the sustainability issue stricto sensu.\n127. Such a restriction allows focusing on what the literature calls a “wealth” or “stock-\nbased” approach to sustainability. The idea is the following: the well-being of future\ngenerations compared to ours will depend on what resources we pass on to them. Many\ndifferent forms of resource are involved here. Future well-being will depend upon the\nmagnitude of the stocks of exhaustible resources that we leave to the next generations. It will\ndepend also on how well we maintain the quantity and quality of all the other renewable\nnatural resources that are necessary for life. From a more economic point of view, it will also\ndepend upon how much physical capital – machines and buildings – we pass on, and how\nmuch we devote to the constitution of the human capital of future generations, essentially\nthrough expenditure on education and research. And it also depends upon the quality of the\ninstitutions that we transmit to them, which is still another form of “capital” that is crucial for\nmaintaining a properly functioning human society.\n7.\nEvidence and references in support of the claims presented in this Summary are presented in a companion\ntechnical report.\n\n62\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n128. How can we measure whether enough of these assets will be left or accumulated for\nfuture generations? In other words, when can we say that we are currently living above our\nmeans? In particular, is there any reasonable hope of being able to characterize this with one\nsimple number that could play the role for sustainability that GDP has long played for the\nmeasurement of economic performance? One reason for such a quest would be to avoid the\nmultiplication of competing numbers. However, if we want to accomplish this, we need to\nconvert all the stocks of resources passed on to future generations into a common metric, be it\nmonetary or not. \n129. We shall discuss in some detail why such a goal seems overly ambitious. The\naggregation of heterogeneous items seems possible up to a point for physical and human\ncapital or some natural resources that are traded on markets. But the task appears much more\ncomplicated for most natural assets, due to the lack of relevant market prices and to the many\nuncertainties concerning the way these natural assets will interact with other dimensions of\nsustainability in the future. This will lead us to suggest a pragmatic approach that combines a\nmonetary indicator, which could send us reasonable signals about economic sustainability,\nand a set of physical indicators devoted to environmental issues. We provide some examples\nof such physical indicators, yet, in the end, the choice of the most relevant ones must be left to\nspecialists from other fields, before submission to the public debate.\n2 - Taking stock\n130. Providing a brief summary of the very abundant literature that has been devoted to the\nmeasurement of sustainability or durable development is not an easy task. We will use an\nimperfect but simple typology that distinguishes (1) large and eclectic dashboards, (2)\ncomposite indices, (3) indices that consist of correcting GDP in a more or less extensive way,\nand (4) indices that essentially focus on measuring how far we currently “overconsume” our\nresources. This last category is itself heterogeneous, since we shall include in it indices as\ndifferent as the ecological footprint and adjusted net savings, which, as we shall see, convey\nvery different messages. \n2.1 - Dashboards or sets of indicators\n131. Dashboards or sets of indicators are one widespread approach to the general question of\nsustainable development. This approach involves gathering and ordering a series of indicators\nthat bear a direct or indirect relationship to socio-economic progress and its durability. In the\nlast couple of decades, international organizations have played a major role in the emergence\nof sustainability dashboards, with the United Nations playing a prominent role. In particular,\nthe 1992 Rio Summit adopted Agenda 21, whose 40th chapter invites the signatory countries\nto develop quantitative information about their actions and accomplishments. \n132. Other international initiatives to build sustainable development dashboards have been\ntaken by the OECD and Eurostat, following the European Council’s adoption of its own\nSustainable Development Strategy in 2001. The current version of this dashboard includes 11\nindicators for level 1 (Table 3.1), 33 indicators for level 2, and 78 indicators for level 3, with\nthe level 2 and 3 indicators covering 29 sub-themes. Similar national initiatives have\naccompanied this general movement, albeit in a somewhat scattered way. Local initiatives\nhave also mushroomed over the last decade, some based on the initial impetus from\nAgenda 21. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n63\n133. For the user, the most striking feature of this very abundant literature is the extreme\nvariety of the indicators proposed. Some are very comprehensive – GDP growth retains its\nplace, and is even the first indicator in the European Dashboard – while others are much more\nspecific, such as the percentage of smokers in the population. Some pertain to outcomes,\nothers to instruments. Some can easily be related both to development and to sustainability –\nliteracy performance matters for both current well-being and future growth – but others\npertain only either to current development or to long-run sustainability. There are even some\nitems whose link with both dimensions is questionable or at least of indeterminate sign: is a\nhigh fertility rate a good thing for sustainability? Maybe yes for the sustainability of pensions,\nbut maybe not for environmental sustainability. And is it always a signal of good economic\nperformance? This probably depends on what we consider “high” or “low” in terms of\nfertility. \n134. These dashboards are useful in at least two respects. First, they are an initial step in any\nanalysis of sustainability, which by its nature is highly complex and therefore necessitates an\neffort at establishing a list of relevant variables and encouraging national and international\nstatistical offices to improve the measurement of these indicators. The second one is related to\nthe distinction between “weak” and “strong” sustainability. The “weak” approach to\nsustainability considers that good performance in some dimensions can compensate for low\nperformance in others. This allows a global assessment of sustainability using mono-\ndimensional indices. The “strong” approach argues that sustainability requires separately\nmaintaining the quantity or quality of many different environmental items. Following this up\ntherefore requires large sets of separate statistics, each pertaining to one particular subdomain\nof global sustainability. \n135. Dashboards nevertheless suffer because of their heterogeneity, at least in the case of very\nlarge and eclectic ones, and most lack indications about causal links, their relationship to\nsustainability, and/or hierarchies amongst the indicators used. Further, as communications\ninstruments, one frequent criticism is that they lack what has made GDP a success: the\npowerful attraction of a single headline figure allowing simple comparisons of socio-\neconomic performance over time or across countries.  \n\n64\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nTable 3.1. Reviewed list of European sustainable development indicators (level 1)\nSource: Eurostat, 2007.(http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-77-07-115/EN/KS-77-07-115-EN.PDF)\n2.2 - Composite indices\n136. Composite indices are one way to circumvent the problem raised by the richness of\ndashboards and to synthesize the abundant and purportedly relevant information into a single\nnumber. The technical report reviews a few of these. \n137. For example, Osberg and Sharpe’s Index of Economic Well-Being is a composite\nindicator that simultaneously covers current prosperity (based on measures of consumption),\nsustainable accumulation, and social topics (reduction in inequalities and protection against\n“social” risks). Environmental issues are addressed by considering the costs of CO2\nemissions per capita. Consumption flows and wealth accumulation (defined broadly to\ninclude R&D stocks, a proxy for human capital, and the costs of CO2 emissions) are\nevaluated according to national accounts methodology. Each dimension is normalized\nthrough linear scaling (nine OECD countries) and aggregation relies on equal weighting. But\nat this stage the “green” dimension of this index is still secondary.\n138. Other examples focus more specifically on the green dimension, such as the\n“Environmental Sustainability Index” (ESI) and the “Environmental Performance Index”\n(EPI). The ESI covers 5 domains: environmental systems (their global health status),\nenvironmental stress (anthropogenic pressure on the environmental systems), human\nvulnerability (exposure of inhabitants to environmental disturbances), social and institutional\ncapacity (their capacity to foster effective responses to environmental challenges), and global\nstewardship (cooperation with other countries in the management of common environmental\nproblems). It uses 76 variables to cover these 5 domains. There are, for instance, standard\nindicators for air and water quality (e.g. SO2 and NOx), health parameters (e.g. infant death\nrate from respiratory diseases), environmental governance (e.g local Agenda 21 initiatives per\nmillion people), etc. The EPI is a reduced form of the ESI, based on 16 indicators (outcomes),\nand is more policy-oriented. \n139. The messages derived from this kind of index are ambiguous. The global ranking of\ncountries has some sense, but it is often considered to present an overly optimistic view of\nTheme\nLevel 1 indicators\n1: Socio-economic development\nGrowth rate of GDP per inhabitant\n2: Sustainable consumption and \nproduction\nResource productivity\n3: Social inclusion\nAt-risk-of-poverty rate after social transfers\n4: Demographic changes\nEmployment rate of older workers  \n5: Public health\nHealthy life years and life expectancy at birth\n6: Sustainable development\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions \nConsumption of renewables \n7: Sustainable transport\nEnergy consumption of transport\n8: Natural resources\nCommon bird index \nFish catches outside safe biological limits\n9: Global partnership\nOfficial Development Assistance (ODA)\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n65\ndeveloped countries’ contribution to environmental problems. Problems also arise between\ndeveloped countries. For instance, the index shows a very narrow gap between the United\nStates and France, despite strong differences in terms of their CO2 emissions. In fact, the\nindex essentially informs us about a mix of current environmental quality, of pressure on\nresources and of the intensity of environmental policy, but not about whether a country is\nactually on a sustainable path: no threshold value can be defined on either side of which we\nwould be able to say that a country is or is not on a sustainable path. \n140. On the whole, these composite indicators are better regarded as invitations to look more\nclosely at the various components that underlie them. This kind of function of composite\nindicators has often been put forward as one of their main raisons d’être. But this is not\nreason enough to retain them as measures of sustainability stricto sensu which could secure\nthe same standing as GDP or other accounting concepts. There are two reasons for this. First,\nas with large dashboards, there is the lack of a well-defined notion of what sustainability\nmeans. The second is a general criticism that is frequently addressed at composite indicators,\ni.e. the arbitrary character of the procedures used to weight their various components. These\naggregation procedures are sometimes presented as superior to the monetary aggregations that\nare used to build most economic indices, because they are not linked to any form of market\nvaluation. Indeed, and we shall come back to this point several times, there are many reasons\nwhy market values cannot be trusted when addressing sustainability issues, and more\nspecifically their environmental component. But monetary or not, an aggregation procedure\nalways means putting relative values on the items that are introduced in the index. In the case\nof composite sustainability indicators, we have little understanding of the arguments for\nputting one relative value or another on all the different variables that matter for\nsustainability. The problem is not that these weighting procedures are hidden, non-transparent\nor non-replicable – they are often very explicitly presented by the authors of the indices, and\nthis is one of the strengths of this literature. The problem is rather that their normative\nimplications are seldom made explicit or justified.  \n2.3 - Adjusted GDPs\n141. Other candidates for the measurement of sustainability are those that restart from the\nconventional notion of GDP but try to systematically augment or correct it using elements\nthat standard GDP does not take into account and that matter for sustainability. \n142. Nordhaus and Tobin’s sustainable measure of economic welfare (SMEW) may be\nregarded as the common ancestor to this strand. They provided two indicators. The first was a\nMeasure of Economic Welfare (MEW) obtained by subtracting from total private\nconsumption a number of components that do not contribute positively to welfare (such as\ncommuting and legal services) and by adding monetary estimates of activities that do\ncontribute positively to welfare (such as leisure and work at home). The second step consisted\nin converting the MEW into the SMEW by taking into account changes in total wealth. The\nSMEW measures the level of MEW that is compatible with preserving the capital stock. To\nconvert the MEW into the SMEW, Nordhaus and Tobin used an estimate of total public and\nprivate wealth, including reproducible capital, non-reproducible capital (limited to land and\nnet foreign assets), educational capital (based on the cumulated cost of years spent in\neducation by people belonging to the labor force) and health capital, based on a permanent\ninventory method with a depreciation rate of 20% per year. But they did not in the end include\nestimates of environmental damage or natural resource depletion.\n\n66\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n143. Two strands have developed from this seminal contribution. The first has tried to enrich\nNordhaus and Tobin’s approach, sometimes deviating increasingly from the criterion of\naccounting consistency. Examples include the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare\n(ISEW) and the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). These indicators deduct some evaluations\nof the costs of water, air and noise pollution from consumption and also try to account for the\nloss of wetlands, farmland, and primary forests, and for other natural resource depletion, and\nfor CO2 damage and ozone depletion. Natural resources depletion is valued by measuring the\ninvestment necessary to generate a perpetual equivalent stream of renewable substitutes.  \n144. In all countries for which both ISEW and GPI are available, their values are very similar\nand at some point in time start diverging from GDP. This has led some authors to put forward\na so-called “threshold” hypothesis, according to which GDP and welfare move in the same\ndirection up to a certain point, beyond which the continuation of GDP growth does not allow\nany further improvement in well-being. In other words, according to such indicators,\nsustainability is already far behind us, and we have already entered a phase of decline.\n145. The other strand is more firmly integrated into the realm of national accounting. It is\nbased on the so-called System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA), a satellite\naccount of the Standard National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA brings together economic and\nenvironmental information in a common framework to measure the contribution of the\nenvironment to the economy and the impact of the economy on the environment. The UN\nCommittee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting (UNCEEA), created in 2005,\nis now looking to mainstream environmental-economic accounting, to elevate the SEEA to an\ninternational statistical standard by 2010 and to advance SEEA implementation in countries.\n146. The SEEA comprises four categories of accounts. The first considers purely physical\ndata related to flows of materials (materials drawn into the economy and residuals produced\nas waste) and energy and marshals them as far as possible according to the SNA accounting\nstructure The second category of accounts takes those elements of the existing SNA that are\nrelevant to the good management of the environment and makes the environment-related\ntransactions more explicit. The third category of accounts comprises accounts for\nenvironmental assets measured in physical and monetary terms (timber stock accounts, for\ninstance).\n147. These first three categories of the SEEA are vital building blocks for any form of\nsustainability indicator. But what is at stake here is the fourth and last category of SEEA\naccounts, which deals with how the existing SNA might be adjusted to account (exclusively\nin monetary terms) for the impact of the economy on the environment. Three sorts of\nadjustments are considered: those relating to resource depletion, those concerning so-called\ndefensive expenditures (protection expenditures being the most emblematic ones), and those\nrelating to environmental degradation. \n148. It is these environmental adjustments to existing SNA aggregates that are better known\nunder the rather loose expression of “Green GDP”, which is an extension of the concept of net\ndomestic product. Indeed, just as GDP (Gross) is turned into NDP (Net) by accounting for the\nconsumption of fixed capital (depreciation of produced capital), the idea is that it would be\nmeaningful to compute an “ea-NDP” (environmentally-adjusted) that takes into account the\nconsumption of natural capital. The latter would comprise resource depletion (the over-use of\nenvironmental assets as inputs to the production process) and environmental degradation (the\nvalue of the decline in the quality of a resource, roughly speaking).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n67\n149. Green GDP and eaNDP remain, however, the most controversial outcomes of the\nSEEA, and as such are less implemented by statistical offices, because of the many problems\nthat are raised by these two concepts. Valuing environmental inputs into the economic system\nis the (relatively) easier step. Since these inputs are incorporated into products that are sold in\nthe market place, it is possible (in principle) to use direct means to assign a value for them\nbased on market principles. In contrast, as pollution emissions are outputs, there is no direct\nway to assign a value to them. All the indirect methods of valuation will depend to some\nextent on “what if” scenarios. Thus, translating valuations of degradation into adjustments to\nmacro-economic aggregates takes us beyond the realm of ex-post accounting into a much\nmore hypothetical situation. The very speculative nature of this sort of accounting explains\nthe great discomfort and strong resistance among many accountants to this practice.\n150. But there is a more fundamental problem with green GDP, which also applies to\nNordhaus and Tobin’s SMEW and to the ISEW/GNI indices. None of these measures\ncharacterize sustainability per se. Green GDP just charges GDP for the depletion of or\ndamage to environmental resources. This is only one part of the answer to the question of\nsustainability. What we ultimately need is an assessment of how far we are from these\nsustainable targets. In other words, what we need are measures of overconsumption or, to put\nin dual terms, of underinvestment. This is precisely what our last category of indicators\npurports to do. \n2.4 - Indicators focusing on overconsumption or underinvestment\n151. Under this heading, we group all kinds of indicators that address the issue of\nsustainability in terms of overconsumption, underinvestment or excessive pressure on\nresources. Though such indicators tend to be presented in flow terms, they are built upon the\nassumption that some stocks that are relevant for sustainability correspond to the measured\nflows, i.e. stocks that are being transmitted to future generations and determine their\nopportunity sets. As with GDP and other aggregates, trying to perform this task with a single\nnumber requires the choice of a metric and an explicit aggregation procedure for these stocks\nand their variations.\n2.4.1. Adjusted net savings (ANS) \n152. Adjusted net savings (also known as genuine savings or genuine investment) is a\nsustainability indicator that builds on the concepts of green national accounts but reformulates\nthese concepts in terms of stock or wealth rather than flows of income or consumption. The\ntheoretical background is the idea that sustainability requires the maintenance of a constant\nstock of “extended wealth”, which is not limited to natural resources but also includes\nphysical, productive capital, as measured in traditional national accounts, and human capital.\nNet adjusted savings is taken to be the change in this total wealth over a given time period,\nsuch as a year. Such a concept clearly appears to be the relevant economic counterpart of the\nnotion of sustainability, in that it includes not only natural resources but also (in principle at\nleast) those other ingredients necessary to provide future generations an opportunity set that is\nat least as large as what is currently available to living generations. \n\n68\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n153. Empirically, adjusted net savings are derived from standard national accounting\nmeasures of gross national savings by making four types of adjustment. First, estimates of the\ncapital consumption of produced assets are deducted to obtain net national savings. Second,\ncurrent expenditures on education are added to net domestic savings as an appropriate value\nfor investment in human capital (in standard national accounting these expenditures are\ntreated as consumption). Finally, estimates of the depletion of a variety of natural resources\nare deducted to reflect the decline in asset values associated with their extraction and harvest.\nEstimates of resource depletion are based on the calculation of resource rents. An economic\nrent represents the “excess” return to a given factor of production. Rents are derived by taking\nthe difference between world prices and the average unit extraction or harvest cost (including\na “normal” return on capital). Finally, global pollution damages from carbon dioxide\nemissions are deducted8. Negative adjusted net savings rates imply that “extended wealth” is\nin decline, and as such provide a warning of non-sustainability.\n154. How does this indicator compare with standard measures of saving and investment in\nnational accounts? World Bank-computed ANS for developed countries such as France and\nthe United States shows that changes over time are  almost exclusively driven by gross\nsavings, while the gap in levels between ANS and gross savings is due mostly to capital\nconsumption and human capital accumulation whereas, according to the index, natural capital\nchanges play only a relatively marginal role. Moreover, the ANS figures show that most\ndeveloped countries are on a sustainable path, while many emerging or developing countries\nare not. In particular, according to this measure most natural resource-exporting countries are\non a non-sustainable path (Figure 3.1).\nFigure 3.1. Geographical distribution for Adjusted Net Savings\nSource: World Bank, data for 2006. \nReading: Countries are ranked from the most unsustainable (in white) to the most sustainable (in dark). Non-sustainability\ncan be due either to the overextraction of exhaustible resources or to low investment in human and physical capital. The\nfrontiers of countries with missing values are not represented. \n8.\nAs for local pollution damages, these are difficult to estimate without location-specific data. Nevertheless, an\naugmented version of ANS for local pollution is also provided by taking into account health damage due to urban\nair pollution (particulate matter PM10).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n69\n155. This kind of approach appeals to to many economists, as it is grounded on an explicit\ntheoretical framework. However, the current methodology underlying empirical calculations\nhas well-known shortcomings: the relevance of the ANS approach crucially depends on what\nis counted (the different forms of capital passed on to future generations), namely, what is\nincluded in “extended wealth”, and on the price used to count and aggregate in a context of\nimperfect or indeed nonexistent valuation by markets – the problem that we already\nmentioned when discussing the implicit prices used by composite indicators. \n156. Indeed, a major shortcoming of ANS estimates is that the adjustment for environmental\ndegradation is only limited to a restricted set of pollutants, the most significant one being\ncarbon dioxide emissions. The authors acknowledge that the calculations do not include other\nimportant sources of environmental degradation, such as underground water depletion,\nunsustainable fisheries, and soil degradation, and a fortiori biodiversity loss. \n157. For those natural assets that are taken into account, pricing techniques remain the major\nissue.  For exhaustible resources, the World Bank’s estimates of ANS rely on current prices.\nIn theory, the use of market prices to evaluate flows and stocks is warranted only in a context\nof perfect markets, which is clearly not the case in reality, and especially not for natural\nresources, where externalities and uncertainties are paramount. Further, market prices for\nfossil energy sources and other minerals have tended, in recent years, to fluctuate widely,\ncausing significant swings in measures of ANS based on current market prices and this has\nvery strongly reduced the practical relevance of the ANS for concerned countries.\n158. As for pricing environmental degradation, things turn out to be even trickier because of\nthe absence of any market valuation that could be used as a starting point: in theory, we must\nevaluate so-called “accounting prices” by modeling the long-term consequences of given\nchanges in environmental capital and how they impact future well-being. But practical\nimplementation raises considerable problems. Under the current state of the art, the prices\nused to value carbon emissions in existing estimates of ANS are not able to give it any\nsignificant role in the global assessment of sustainability, and this casts doubts on the\nusefulness of the indicator as a guide for policy.  \n159. Finally, by computing ANS per country we miss the global nature of sustainability.\nIndeed, one may feel uneasy when faced with the message conveyed by ANS about resource-\nexporting countries (e.g. oil). In these countries, from the ANS perspective, non-sustainability\nstems from an insufficient rate of reinvestment of the income generated by the exploitation of\nthe natural resource: “over-consumption” by importing countries is not an issue at all.\nDeveloped countries, which are generally less endowed with natural resources but richer in\nhuman and physical capital than developing ones, would then appear unduly sustainable. As a\nconsequence, some authors have argued in favor of imputing the consumption of exhaustible\nresources to their final consumers, i.e. the importing countries.If \nscarcities \nwere \nfully\nreflected in the prices at which exhaustible resources are sold on international markets, it is\ntrue that there would be no reason for making such a correction. However, when prices are\nnon-competitive, the importing country pays less for its imports than would be required; it\nwill have a responsibility in global non-sustainability that is not captured by the money-value\nof its imports. Low prices allow such countries to over-consume and to transfer the long-term\ncosts of this over-consumption to the exporting countries. \n\n70\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n2.4.2. Footprints\n160. Although apparently quite different from “extended wealth” notions, various attempts at\nmeasuring sustainability through the use of “footprints” are also inspired by the general\napproach of comparing current flows of consumption and their effects on certain dimensions\nof the environment with an existing stock. In this sense, they may also be regarded as\n“wealth” measures. However the focus is exclusively on natural capital, and the valuation\nconvention differs from the ANS one in that no market prices are explicitly used. \n161. The Ecological Footprint (hereafter EF) measures how much of the regenerative\ncapacity of the biosphere is used up by human activities (consumption). It does so by\ncalculating the amount of biologically productive land and water area required to support a\ngiven population at its current level of consumption. A country’s Footprint (demand side) is\nthe total area required to produce the food, fiber and timber that it consumes, absorb the waste\nthat it generates, and provide space for its infrastructure (built-up areas). On the supply side,\nbiocapacity is the productive capacity of the biosphere and its ability to provide a flux of\nbiological resources and services useful to humankind. \n162. The results are well-known and rather striking: since the mid-1980s, humanity’s\nfootprint has been larger than the planet's carrying capacity, and in 2003 humanity’s total\nFootprint exceeded the Earth’s biocapacity by approximately 25 per cent. While 1.8 global\nhectares per person are available world-wide, Europeans use 4.9 global hectares per person\nand North Americans use twice that amount, that is, much more than the actual bio-capacity\nof those two geographical zones (Figure 3.2).\nFigure 3.2 : Ecological footprint by country\nSource : Global Footprint Network, data for year 2005\nReading : Dark areas correspond to countries with the highest values for the ecological footprint, i.e. with the highest\ncontributions to worldwide unsustainability.  Countries with missing values are not represented\n163. This indicator shares with accounting approaches the idea of reducing heterogeneous\nelements to one common measurement unit (the global hectare, e.g one hectare with\nproductivity equal to the average productivity of the 11.2 billion bioproductive hectares on\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n71\nEarth). It assumes that different forms of natural capital are substitutable and that different\nnatural capital goods are additive in terms of land area, but strongly stands against weak\nsustainability assumptions. In fact, this indicator gives no role to savings and capital\naccumulation: any positive ecological surplus (biocapacity that exceeds the ecological\nfootprint) does not entail an increase in some natural capital stock, and hence an improvement\nin future productive capacity. A fortiori, saving and accumulating manufactured or human\ncapital does not help sustainability. On the other hand, one must observe that the indicator\nignores the threat to sustainability resulting from the depletion of non-renewable resources\n(e.g. oil): the consequences for sustainability are treated only from the waste assimilation\n(implied CO2 emissions) point of view rather than from an analysis based on depletion\ndynamics.\n164. The results are also problematic for measuring a country’s own sustainability, because\nof the substantial anti-trade bias inherent in the Ecological Footprint methodology. The fact\nthat densely populated (low biocapacity) countries like the Netherlands have ecological\ndeficits, whilst sparsely populated (high biocapacity) countries like Finland enjoy surpluses\ncan be seen as part of a normal situation where trade is mutually beneficial, rather than an\nindicator of non-sustainability. Indeed, recent reearch has tended to move away from\ncomparing a country’s EF with its own biocapacity, and to propose instead to divide all\ncountries’ EFs by global biocapacity. By doing this, one is acknowledging that EFs are not\nmeasures of a country’s own sustainability but of its contribution to global non-sustainability. \n165. Overall, this means that the Ecological Footprint could at best be an indicator of\ninstantaneous non-sustainability at the worldwide level. EFs for countries should be used as\nindicators of inequality in the exploitation of natural resources and interdependencies between\ngeographical areas. Moreover, even the worldwide ecological deficit emphasized by the EF\nmay not convey the message it is said to. Indeed, one can show that the worldwide imbalance\nis mostly driven by CO2 emissions, expressed in hectares of forest needed for storage. By\ndefinition, the worldwide demand placed on cropland, built-up land and pasture cannot\nexceed world biocapacity.\n166. As a result, less-encompassing but more-rigorously-defined footprints, such as the\n“Carbon Footprint” (CF), would seem better-suited, insofar as they are more clearly physical\nmeasures of stocks that do not rely on specific assumptions about productivity or an\nequivalence factor. As far as communications is concerned, such an indicator is just as\ncapable of sending strong messages in terms of the over-utilization of the planet’s capacity for\nabsorption. The CF also has the interesting feature of being computable at any level of\ndisaggregation. This makes it a powerful instrument for monitoring the behavior of individual\nactors.\n 3 - Quantifying sustainability in a consensual way: what are the main stumbling \nblocks? \n167. Let’s summarize the main messages so far. The previous section has shown the large\nnumber of existing attempts to quantify sustainability. This abundance of measures is a\nserious drawback insofar as different synthetic indicators convey widely divergent messages.\nThis leads to a great deal of confusion among statisticians and policymakers. It urges a return\nto the fundamental questions: What do we want to measure exactly? What are the real\nobstacles to doing so with a single headline measure? \n\n72\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n3.1 - What do we want to measure? \n168. Since the Brundtland Report, the notion of sustainable development has expanded to\nbecome an all-encompassing concept that absorbs every dimension of present and future\neconomic, social and environmental well-being. Such an ambition is justified, but it covers all\nthe domains considered by the three subgroups of the Commission. The mandate of our\nenvironment/sustainability subgroup was narrower than that: it concentrated on the\n“sustainable” component of “sustainable development”. This question of durability can be\nexpressed in the following terms: assuming we have been able to assess what is the current\nlevel of well-being, the question is whether the continuation of present trends does or does not\nallow it to be maintained.\n169. It seems reasonable to separate the two notions of current well-being and of its\nsustainability, because the two questions are interesting in themselves. This provides a first\nguide for sorting out the many different approaches reviewed in the first half of this chapter. \n• The extensive dashboards of sustainable development reviewed in section 2.1\neffectively conflate the measurement of current well-being and the measurement of its\nsustainability. This is not to say that dashboards are of no use. Quite the contrary: our\nfinal conclusion will be that a unidimensional view of sustainability certainly remains\nout of reach. But we do want to end up with a limited number of indicators – a “micro”\ndashboard – and one that is specifically dedicated to the sustainability issue, based on a\nclear notion of what sustainability means.\n• Composite indicators raise similar problems, with the additional complication that the\nway in which various items are weighted is arbitrary, with consequences that are seldom\nmade explicit. \n• Measures of a sustainable standard of living, such as the Green GDP, are also\ninsufficient for assessing sustainability. The proximity that such a sustainability\nindicator would necessarily have with standard GDP could be a source of confusion. If\nthere are two GDP indicators, which one should we use in which context? What\nconclusion would we draw from the fact that a given country’s green GDP is x% or y%\nof its GDP defined in standard terms? Does this necessarily imply that this country is on\nan unsustainable path? \n170. In fact, green GDP focuses on only one side of the problem, i.e. the measurement of\nwhat can be consumed every year without environmental impoverishment. This does not tell\nus whether we are on a sustainable path. If we want to measure sustainability, what is required\nis a comparison between this concept of genuine production and current consumption. All\nthis makes the appropriate sustainability index more akin to a concept of net investment or\ndisinvestment, and this is precisely the route that extended wealth or ANS exemplifies, but\nwhich is also implicitly followed by footprint indicators that are more specifically focused on\nthe renewal or depletion of environmental assets. The argument goes as follows: the capacity\nof future generations to have standards of well-being at least equal to ours depends upon our\npassing them sufficient amounts of all the assets that matter for well-being. If we denote by\n“W” the “extended wealth” index used to quantify this stock of resources, measuring\nsustainability amounts to testing whether this global stock or some of its components evolve\npositively or negatively, i.e. computing its or their current rates of change, dW or dWi. If\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n73\nnegative, this means that downward adjustments in consumption or well-being will be\nrequired sooner or later. This is exactly what one should understand by “non-sustainability”. \n171. In our view, such a formulation of the sustainability issue has the potential to provide\nthe common language necessary for constructive debates between people from very different\nperspectives. To take just one example, it fully answers one of the longstanding objections\nmade to GDP by environmentalists, i.e. the fact that ecological catastrophes can increase GDP\nthrough their implied impact on economic activity. In an extended wealth approach, an\necological catastrophe is registered as a destruction of capital. This accounts for the fact that it\ndeteriorates sustainability by decreasing the resources available for generating future well-\nbeing. This outcome can be avoided only if some action is taken to repair the damage, with\nthese actions being counted as positive investment. \n3.2 - Summarizing sustainability in one number: is it realistic? \n172. Now, we have seen that both ANS and footprint evaluations are subject to many\nobjections and can be considered, at best, as proxies of what would be genuine indices of\nchanges in extended wealth or its components. Returning to fundamentals means asking\nprecisely what would be required to measure the above-mentioned dW indices in a\nsatisfactory way. Assuming away the measurement problems at first, we have to be more\nspecific about several concepts: What is to be sustained? How do the various assets that will\nbe passed on to future generations affect this measure of well-being? And how should they be\nweighted against each other? \n173. It is clearly this last question that is more problematic and tends to crystallize opposition\nbetween the proponents of monetary indicators and physical indicators. Is there actually some\nreasonable prospect of evaluating everything in money units, or should we accept that this is\npossible only up to a certain point? \n174. If all assets were traded on perfect markets by perfectly forward-looking agents fully\ntaking into account the welfare of future generations, one could argue that their current prices\nreflect the discounted streams of their future contributions to future well-being. But many\nassets are not traded at all, and even for those that are it is unlikely that current prices fully\nreflect this future-oriented dimension, due to market imperfections, myopia and uncertainty.\nThis implies that a true measure of sustainability requires a dW index in which assets are\nvalued not at market prices, but rather using imputed “accounting prices” based on some\nobjective physical or economic modeling of how future damage to the environment will affect\nwell-being, just as it requires an exact evaluation of how current additions to the stock of\nhuman or physical capital are likely to improve or help maintain well-being in the future.  \n175. Recent research has clarified the requisites of such an exercise. One is a full set of\neconomic and physical projection of how initial conditions determine the future joint path of\neconomic, social and environmental variables. Another is the a priori definition of how this\npath translates in terms of well-being at all future dates, i.e. the knowledge of the social utility\nfunction, generally formalized as a discounted sum of well-being over all future periods. \n176. Equipped with such instruments, it should be possible to derive sustainability indices\nthat have the properties that one would expect, i.e. a capacity to anticipate future declines in\nwell-being below its current level. Some simulations proposed in the technical report\nillustrate certain aspects of this capacity. First of all, this sustainability index is the best suited\n\n74\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nfor sending correct forewarnings to countries that are on unsustainable paths because of an\ninsufficient rate of accumulation or of renewal of their produced capital, be it human or\nphysical. And this is of course an important property: even if environmental issues are of\nconsiderable importance, we cannot ignore these other dimensions of sustainability.\n177. Second, such an indicator is inconsistent with the “strong” view of non-sustainability\n(i.e. problems arising from the depreciation of environmental assets that are essential to\nhuman well-being or even survival) only when it relies on fixed price levels for natural and\nnon-natural assets. But if we were able to derive this index from a physical-economic model\npredicting future interactions between the economy and the environment in a reliable way,\nthen this index would send us correct forewarnings of non-sustainability, through strong\nincreases in the relative accounting or “imputed” prices of these critical natural assets. \n178. But the problem is with those “ifs”. This construction remains fully theoretical. It shows\nus at best the direction in which index builders could try to go. It can also be used as a tool for\nemphasizing the many obstacles to the building of a comprehensive index and the need for\nmore pragmatic second-best solutions.   \n3.3 - Technological uncertainties argue in favor of a more hybrid approach \n179. Measuring sustainability with a single dW index can work only under two strong\nassumptions: one is that future eco-environmental developments can be predicted perfectly,\nand the second is that there is perfect knowledge about how these developments are going to\naffect well-being. These two assumptions are clearly at odds with our real world situation.\nDebates on eco-environmental perspectives are dominated by ignorance and uncertainty\nabout future interactions between the two spheres, and by a lack of consensus about the very\ndefinition of the objective function. \n180. Let’s briefly develop the first point. The future is fundamentally uncertain. Uncertainty\ntakes many forms, some of them amenable to probability computation, while many others are\nmuch more radical. This affects not only the parameters of any models that one may try to use\nto project eco-environmental interactions, but also the structure of the models themselves, the\nmeasurement of current stocks, and even the list of the natural assets for which current and\nfuture stocks need to be taken into account. Most of the debate concerning long-term\nenvironmental change reflects different beliefs about future eco-environmental scenarios.\nThere is no reason why sustainability measurement should escape such difficulties. \n181. Some solutions might be considered for this problem. One is to do what all\nprospectivists do when they want to emphasize the uncertain nature of future trends, i.e. work\nwith scenarios or provide confidence intervals. One could also consider submitting indices to\nsome forms of “stress tests”, i.e. recompute them under assumptions of external shocks on\nasset values. This could include sudden upward adjustments in the value of environmental\nassets, but also drastic reductions in the value of some other items – such as produced capital\nand human capital. Such modes of presentation could be explored and eventually adopted. \n182. But this could still be insufficient or difficult to present in a convenient way. Questions\nsuch as climate change require a specific consideration which drives us back to the distinction\nbetween weak and strong sustainability. The point is not that aggregate indices are by nature\nunable to account for situations of strong non-sustainability. The point is that we would be\nable to do so only by adopting extreme valuations of critical environmental assets, and that we\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n75\nare not that well equipped to quantify precisely what these extreme valuations should be.  In\nsuch cases, and a fortiori for items for which we do not even have a single guestimate of a\nmonetary value, a separate physical accounting is unavoidable. \n183. The problem then is to present such an index in a compelling way. Monetary indices\nhave the advantage of using units that speak to everyone. In addition, they can be related to\nother monetary quantities: this is what we do when we compute extended savings rates, and\nthe orders of magnitude of such savings rates can be understood easily. On the other hand, a\ntonnage of CO2 emissions is not a very informative number if we do not have some reference\nfor how many tons can be emitted each year without severe consequences for the climate.\nOther physical indicators have been advocated by climate specialists, including “CO2\nradiative forcing”, measuring the effect of CO2 on the Earth’s energy imbalance, and\nmeasuring the regression of permanent ice. But it is difficult for non-experts to take such\nindicators on board. It is essential to find more suggestive ways to highlight such figures if we\nwant the indicator to have an impact on the debate. One of the major successes of the\necological footprint has been its ability to express pressure on the environment in an easily\nunderstandable unit. The EF indicator has limits that make it problematic to many observers.\nBut, given the objective of limiting climate change, the general idea of using the footprint as a\ngeneric unit for the different forms of pressure that mankind exerts on Earth’s regenerative\ncapacity is an option. A metric like this is used, for instance, with the more focused concept of\nthe Carbon Footprint or the kindred concept of the CO2 budget. \n3.4 - Uncertainty is also normative \n184. In addition to raising technological issues, measuring sustainability with a single index\nnumber would confront us with severe normative questions. The point is that there can be as\nmany indices of sustainability as there are normative definitions of what we want to sustain.\nIn standard national accounting practice, the normative issue of defining preferences is\ngenerally avoided through the assumption that observed prices reveal the true preferences of\npeople. No explicit normative choice is therefore to be made by the statistician. But as soon as\nwe recognise that market prices cannot be trusted, alternative imputed prices must be\ncomputed, whose values will strongly depend upon normative choices. \n185. Can we solve this normative problem?  One could attempt to solve it empirically by\ntrying to infer the definition of well-being from current observations of how people value\nenvironmental factors compared to economic ones, using contingent valuations or direct\nmeasures of the impact of environmental amenities on indices of subjective well-being. But\ncan the contingent evaluations and subjective measures established today in our specific eco-\nenvironmental setting be used to predict the valuations of future generations in eco-\nenvironmental settings that may have become very different? It could be argued that our\ndescendants may become very sensitive to the relative scarcity of some environmental goods\nto which we pay little attention today because they are still relatively abundant, and that this\nrequires that we immediately place a high value on these items just because we think that our\ndescendants may wish to do so. \n186. Another example of these normative issues is the question of determining how\nsustainability indices should aggregate individual preferences. This depends on how\ndistributional considerations are taken into account in our measures of current well-being. For\ninstance, if we consider that the headline indicator of current well-being must be the total\n\n76\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\ndisposable income of the bottom 80% of the population, or of the bottom 50%, rather than\nglobal disposable income, then sustainability indicators should be adapted to such an\nobjective function. This would be in line with one of the other aspects of the Brundtland\ndefinition of sustainability that is often overlooked, i.e. its concern for the distribution of\nresources within as well as between generations. In a world where inequalities within\ncountries naturally tend to increase, messages concerning sustainability will differ depending\non the goal that we set ourselves. Specific attention to distributional issues may even suggest\nenlarging the list of capital goods that matter for sustainability: the “sustainability” of well-\nbeing for the bottom x% of the population may imply some specific investment in institutions\nthat offer efficient help in protecting this population from poverty. In principle, the theoretical\nframework based on extended wealth tells us how we could ideally put some value on this\nkind of “institutional” investment. But, needless to say, the prospect of actually being able to\ndo this is still more remote than for other assets. \n3.5 - An additional source of complexity: the global dimension \n187. A global context poses additional problems for sustainability indicators. Advocates of\nthe ANS argue that sustainability problems generally concentrate in poor resource-exporting\ncountries even if it is in developed countries that the resources are ultimately consumed. The\nargument is that, if markets work properly, the pressure that developed countries exert on\nother countries’ resources is already reflected in the prices that they pay for importing these\nresources. If, despite the cost of their imports, the developed countries can still maintain a\npositive ANS, this means that they invest enough to compensate for their consumption of\nnatural resources. It is then the responsibility of exporting countries to reinvest the income\nfrom their exports in sufficient quantities if they also want to be on a sustainable path. \n188. Yet this logic holds true only under the assumption of efficient markets. If markets are\nnot efficient and if the natural resource is underpriced, then importing countries benefit from\nan implicit subsidy while the exporting ones are effectively taxed. This means that the actual\nsustainability of developed countries is overestimated, while that of the developing countries\nis underestimated. And this problem will be all the more crucial when there are no markets at\nall, or in the presence of strong externalities. \n189. To illustrate this issue, let’s imagine a very simple two-country setting, where both\ncountries produce and consume with external effects on the stock of a natural resource that is\na global public good with free access. Country 2 uses a clean technology that has no impact\non the natural resource, while country 1 uses a “dirty” one that leads to a depreciation of the\nresource. Let’s push the asymmetry further by assuming that it is only country 2 that is\naffected by the degradation of the environmental good. Country 1 is completely indifferent to\nthe level of degradation of this environmental good, for instance because its geographical\ncharacteristics fully protect it from the consequences. \n190. In such a setting, it is natural to redefine countries 1 and 2 as being respectively “the\npolluter” and “the polluted”. In this setting, there are two ways to consider sustainability. One\nis to compute changes in extended wealth for each country using country-specific accounting\nprices for the natural resource. The idea is that the environmental good is a common asset, but\nvalued differently by each country, because they are not concerned in the same way by its\ndegradation. In this example, the accounting price for the polluter will be zero, because we\nhave assumed that it is not impacted at all by environmental changes, which implies that it\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n77\nattributes no value at all to the environmental asset. On the other hand, the polluted country\nwill attribute a positive value to the asset. The message conveyed using this extended wealth\nconcept is that the polluter is on a sustainable path, while the polluted is not.\n191. From a certain point of view, it is correct to say that the polluter is not confronted by the\nprospect of a decline in well-being, in contrast to the polluted. But from another viewpoint,\nthe message is clearly misleading. There is nothing the polluted can do to restore its\nsustainability. It is only a change in the polluter’s technology that could help restore the\npolluted country’s sustainability. We are in need of indices that would convey such a message.\nThe popularity of footprint indicators stems precisely from the fact that, whatever their other\nlimitations, they are able to send such messages to policy makers and public opinion. This is\none more argument in favor of an eclectic approach that mixes points of views. An approach\ncentred on national sustainabilities may be relevant for some dimensions of sustainability, but\nnot for others. Global warming is a typical example of the latter case, as the prospective\nconsequences of climate change are distributed very unevenly, without necessarily correlating\nwith a country’s CO2 emissions. \n4 - Conclusion \n192. To sum up, what have we learnt, and what can we conclude? This trip through the world\nof sustainability indicators has been a bit lengthy, and we have not been able to avoid\ntechnicalities completely. A wide variety of indicators are already available and we have\nanalyzed the reasons why a comprehensive assessment of sustainability is difficult to\nestablish in a fully consensual way. Assessing sustainability requires many assumptions and\nnormative choices, and it is further complicated by the existence of interactions between the\nsocio-economic and environmental models followed by the different nations. The issue is\nindeed complex, more complex than the already complicated issue of measuring current well-\nbeing or performance. But we shall nevertheless try to articulate a limited set of\nrecommendations, which we shall also try to keep as pragmatic as possible. \nRecommendation 1: Sustainability assessment requires a well-identified sub-dashboard of the \nglobal dashboard to be recommended by the Commission.\n193. The question of sustainability is complementary to the question of current well-being or\neconomic performance, and must be examined separately. This recommendation to separate\nthe two issues might look trivial. Yet it deserves emphasis, because some approaches fail to\nadopt this principle, leading to confusing messages. The confusion reaches a peak when one\ntries to combine these two dimensions into a single indicator. This criticism applies not only\nto composite indices, but also to the notion of green GDP.  To take an analogy, when driving a\ncar, a meter that weighed up in one single value the current speed of the vehicle and the\nremaining level of gasoline would not be of any help to the driver. Both pieces of information\nare critical and need to be displayed in distinct, clearly visible areas of the dashboard. \nRecommendation 2: The distinctive feature of all components of this sub-dashboard should be \nto inform about variations of those “stocks” that underpin human well-being. \n194. In order to measure sustainability, what we need are indicators that tell us the sign of the\nchange in the quantities of the different factors that matter for future well-being. Putting the\nsustainability issue in these terms compels recognition that sustainability requires the\n\n78\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nsimultaneous preservation or increase in several “stocks”: quantities and qualities not only of\nnatural resources but also of human, social and physical capital. Any approach that focuses on\nonly a part of these items does not offer a comprehensive view of sustainability. \n195. Speaking in such terms also avoids many of the misconceptions about the messages sent\nby traditional national accounts indicators. For instance, a frequent criticism of GDP is that it\nclassifies ecological catastrophes as blessings for the economy, because of the additional\neconomic activity generated by repairs. The stock approach to sustainability clearly avoids\nthis ambiguity. Catastrophes will be recorded as a form of depreciation of natural or physical\ncapital.  Any resulting increase in economic activity would have a positive value only insofar\nas it helps to restore the initial level of the capital stock. \nRecommendation 3: A monetary index of sustainability has its place in such a dashboard, but \nunder the current state of the art, it should remain essentially focused on economic aspects of \nsustainability.\n196. The stock approach to sustainability can in turn be broken down into two versions. One\nversion would just look at variations in each stock separately with a view to doing whatever is\nnecessary to keep it from declining or at least to keep it above some critical threshold beyond\nwhich further reductions would be highly detrimental to future well-being. Or one could\nattempt to summarize all stock variations in synthetic figures. \n197. This second track is the one followed by so-called extended wealth or adjusted savings\napproaches, which share the idea of converting all these assets into a monetary equivalent. We\nhave discussed the potential of such an approach, but also its limitations. In certain\nconditions, it allows to anticipate many forms of non-sustainability, but the requirements for\nsuch a capacity are extremely high. This is because the aggregation required by this approach\ncannot be based on market values: market prices are nonexistent for quite a large number of\nthe assets that matter for future well-being. Even when they are available, there is no\nguarantee that they adequately reflect how these different assets will matter for future well-\nbeing. In the absence of such price messages, we have to turn to imputations, which raises\nboth normative and informational difficulties. \n198. All this suggests staying with a more modest approach, i.e. focusing the monetary\naggregation on items for which reasonable valuation techniques exist, such as physical\ncapital, human capital and natural resources that are traded in markets. This more or less\ncorresponds to the hard part of “adjusted net savings” as computed by the World Bank and\nfurther developed by several authors. “Greening” this index more intensively is of course a\nrelevant objective, and we can keep it on the agenda but we know that the analytical apparatus\nfor doing so is a complex one: large-scale projection models of interactions between the\nenvironment and the economy, projecting changes in the relative scarcities of corresponding\nassets and their impact on relative accounting prices, and allowing also a proper treatment of\nuncertainties or potential irreversibilities that affect these interactions. Meanwhile, we must\nfocus this indicator essentially on what it does relatively well, i.e. the assessment of the\n“economic” component of sustainability, that is, the assessment of whether or not countries\noverconsume their economic wealth. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n79\nRecommendation 4: The environmental aspects of sustainability deserve a separate follow-up \nbased on a well-chosen set of physical indicators. \n199. As far as environmental sustainability is concerned, the limitations of monetary\napproaches do not mean that efforts to monetize damages to the environment are no longer\nneeded: it is well known that fully opposing any kind of monetization often leads to policies\nthat act as if environmental goods had no value at all. The point is that we are far from being\nable to construct monetary values for environmental goods that at the macro level can be\nreasonably compared to market prices of other capital assets. Given our state of ignorance, the\nprecautionary principle legitimates a separate follow-up of these environmental goods.\n200. Another reason for a separate treatment is that these environmental issues often pertain\nto global public goods, such as the case of the climate. In such cases, the problem with the\nstandard extended wealth approach is that it essentially focuses on country-specific\nsustainabilities. With global public goods, what is involved is more the contributions by the\ndifferent countries to global unsustainabilities. \n201. The ecological footprint could have been an option for this kind of follow-up. In\nparticular, in contrast to net adjusted savings, it essentially focuses on contributions to global\nnon-sustainability, with the message that the main responsibility lies with the developed\ncountries. Yet the group has taken note of its limitations, and in particular that it is far from\nbeing a pure physical indicator of pressure on the environment: it retains some aggregation\nrules that may be problematic. In fact, much of the information that it conveys about national\ncontributions to non-sustainability is imbedded in a simpler indicator, the carbon footprint,\nwhich is therefore one good candidate for monitoring humanity’s pressure on the climate,\namong many indicators proposed by climatologists that are shortly reviewed in the technical\nreport.\n202. For other aspects of environmental sustainability, such as air quality, water quality,\nbiodiversity and so on, one can again borrow from these large eclectic dashboards. Just to\nnote a few of the indicators already incorporated in such dashboards, we could mention smog-\nforming pollutant emissions, nutrient loading to water bodies, the abundance of key specified\nnatural species, rates of conversion of natural habitats to other uses, the proportion of fish\ncatches beyond safe biological limits, and many others. Today, at this stage of the debate,\neconomists do not have any particular qualification for suggesting what the right choices are.\nThis is why we will not propose any closed list of these indicators here.\n203. In short, our pragmatic compromise is to suggest a small dashboard, firmly rooted in the\nlogic of the “stock” approach to sustainability, which would combine:\n– An indicator more or less derived from the extended wealth approach, “greened” as far\nas possible on the basis of currently available knowledge, but whose main function,\nhowever, would be to send warning messages concerning “economic” non-\nsustainability. This economic non-sustainability could be due to low savings or low\ninvestment in education, or to insufficient reinvestment of income generated by the\nextraction of fossil resources (for countries that strongly rely on this source of income).\n– A set of well-chosen physical indicators, which would focus on dimensions of\nenvironmental sustainability that are either already important or could become so in the\nfuture, and that remain difficult to capture in monetary terms.\n\n80\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\n204. This scenario has several points of convergence with conclusions reached by other\nreports recently devoted to the topic, such as the recent OECD/Eurostat/UNECE report on\nsustainability measurement, whose conclusions were released in 2008, or the more recent\nreport by the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council released in 2009. The first\none, in particular, strongly advocates the stock-based approach to sustainability and proposes\na small dashboard clearly separating assets that can be monetarized in a reasonable way and\nother assets for which a separate physical measures are necessary. The second one warns\nagaints limits of the Ecological Footprint and, as far as climatic change is concerned, argues\nin favor of the Carbon Footprint index. Such points of convergence are reassuring: they\nsuggest that, from the relatively confused situation that was described in section 2, we are\nsteadily moving towards a more consensual framework for the understanding of sustainability\nissues (See Box 3)9.  \nBox 3 : Physical and other non-monetary indicators : which ones to choose ?\nThe commission’s general position has been to avoid formulating definitive turnkey proposals on any\nthe different issues it has raised. All proposals rather intend to stimulate further debate. This is all the more\ntrue in the domain of physical sustainability indicators where the expertise of specialists from other\ndisciplines is crucial and was only indirectly represented in the commission’s composition. \nSome suggestions can however be made, in connection with conclusions of some recent related\nreports.\n \nIn 2008, a OECD/UNECE/Eurostat working group has produced a report on measuring sustainable\ndevelopment whose messages have several points in common with ours. It strongly advocates the stock-\nbased approach to sustainability as the relevant way of structuring a micro-dashboard of sustainability\nindicators gathering both stock and flow variables. It also suggests a line of demarcation between\ndeterminants of ‘economic’ well-being (those that are the most directly amenable to monetary evaluation)\nand the determinants of ‘foundational’ well-being, among which four couples of stock/flow environmental\nindicators  devoted respectively to global warming, other forms of atmospheric pollution, quality of water\nand biodiversity. The details and positions of these indicators in the dashboard can be visualized (in bold)\non the table below. \n9.\nSome other points of convergence can be found in reactions by the European Environmental Agency to the\nfirst draft of this commission’s summary report.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n81\nSmall set of sustainable development indicators proposed by the UNECE/OECD/Eurostat\n working group on sustainability measurement\nSource : UNECE/OECD/Eurostat (2008)\nMore recently, the French Economic, Social and environmental Council (CESE) has produced a report\nwhose initial aim was the assessment of the Ecological Footprint but that has more widely explored the\ndifferent tracks available for quantifying sustainability. It has the same messages as the current report\nconcerning the limits of this EF index, and the fact that most of the relevant information that it conveys is\nmore directly and more neatly reflected in one of its subcomponents, the carbon footprint. As a\nconsequence, it strongly advocates in favor of this index. Compared to Global GHG emissions suggested\nin the OECD/UNECE/Eurostat Dashboard presented above, the Carbon Footprint has the advantage of\nbeing expressed in this ‘footprint’ unit that is intuitively so appealing and that has made the success of the\nEF. In addition to this, this CESE report has suggested emphasizing the other physical indicators already\npresent in large international dashboards such as the one elaborated for the European Union Strategy for\nSustainable Development. Some of them are those already quoted in the OECD/UNECE/Eurostat\ndashboard. \nAs far as climate change is concerned, some other indicators can be considered. Direct observation of\nmean temperature is one possibility but not the best suited, because it has a tendency to run behind the\nmain components of climate change and because there can always be  disagreements about the causes of\ntemperature rises, hence about their  permanent or transient character. Consequently, climatologists prefer\nto make use of a thermodynamic concept, the CO2 radiative forcing,  that measures the earth energy\nimbalance created by the action of CO2  as a greenhouse gas. \nAlternatively, it is possible to directly use a notion of CO2 remaining budget: according to\nclimatologists, there is an upper limit of 0.75 trillion tonnes of carbon that might be  discharged in the\natsmosphere if the risk of  temperatures exceeding 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels is limited to one-\nin-four, this upperbound at 2°C being largely accepted among climate experts as a \"tipping point” opening\nthe door to unstoppable feedback effects (methane from melting permafrost , CO2 and methane from\ndecaying tropical forests ,all sorts of greenhouse gases released by saturated warming oceans,  etc...). Of\nthis 0.75 total budget, emissions to 2008 have already consumed circa 0.5. Hence the importance of\nmonitoring this remaining CO2 budget. The attractiveness of this indicator is to be strongly consistent with\nthe stock-based approach to sustainability. It can be also rephrased in the very expressive terms of a\ncountdown index, i.e. the time that remains until exhaustion of this stock, under the assumption of\nemissions remaining on their current trend. This kind of representation is often used for other forms of\nexhaustible resources. \nIndicator \ndomain\nStock indicator\nFlow indicator\nFoundational \nwell-being\nHealth-adjusted life expectancy\nIndex of changes in agespecific mortality and \nmorbidity (place holder)\nPercentage of population with post-secondary \neducation\nEnrolment in post-secondary education\nTemperature deviations from Normals\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nGround-level ozone and fine particulate \nconcentrations\nSmog-forming pollutant emissions\nQuality-adjusted water availability\nNutrient loadings to water bodies\nFragmentation of natural habitats\nConversion of natural habitats to other uses\nEconomic \nwell-being\nReal per capita net foreign financial asset \nholdings\nReal per capita investment in foreign financial assets\nReal per capita produced capital\nReal per capita net investment in produced capital\nReal per capita human capital\nReal per capita net investment in human capital\nReal per capita natural capita\nReal per capita net depletion of natural capital\nReserves of energy resources\nDepletion of energy resources\nReserves of mineral resources\nDepletion of mineral resources\nTimber resource stocks\nDepletion of timber resources\nMarine resource stocks\nDepletion of marine resources\n\n82\nSHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT\nStill other indirect indicators of global warming are the regression of permanent ice or the oceanic pH.\nThe regression of permanent ice has the advantage of being an advancedone and to be directly related to\nmanifest effects. The oceanic pH increases with the amount of CO2 that is naturally pumped into the\noceans. A consequence of this increase is a decrease in the quantity of phytoplancton, which is itself a\ncarbon sink no less important than the forests. One may therefore say that the physical sink (sea water\ndissolving atmospheric CO2) destroys the biological one. This is the reason why the oceanic pH appears to\nbe another good tentative indicator of climate change, pointing to one of the most vicious feedback effects.\nAmong criteria for chosing between all the indicators, two are of particular importance. One is their\nappropriability by the public, the other is the capacity of declining them at national or even subnational\nlevels: in this respect, the carbon footprint has quite a lot of advantages.\nAs far as biodiversity is concerned, the issue is currently under review by the TEEB group (“the\neconomics of the environment and biodiversity”) working at the initiative of the European Union and it has\nbeen also recently adressed by a report by the French Conseil d’Analyse Stratégique, in this case with the\nidea of pushing as far as possible the monetization of this dimension. The reason for this search of\nmonetary equivalent is essentially that it may foster incorporation of this dimension in investment choices\n: many public decisions such as building a new motorway imply some potential biodiversity loss through\nfragmentation of natural habitats. But the report provides also a very detailed and technical review of\navailable physical measures of biodiversity, to which the reader is referred for further information.  \nAt last, moving away from environmental preoccupations, but still on the “non-monetary” side, one\nimportant issue is the issue of social capital and “institutional assets” that we transmit to future\ngenerations. One will have noticed that the UNECE/OECD/Eurostat dashboard presented above did not\npropose any indicator of this kind, not because the question is not relevant, but mainly because of lack of\nconsensus about the way to measure it. Subgroup 3 was not in a position to explore this question further,\nbut efforts along this direction remain undoubtedly necessary.  \n205. A subsidiary question concerns a user’s guide to such a dashboard. A warning should be\ngiven that no limited set of figures can pretend to forecast the sustainable or unsustainable\ncharacter of a highly complex system with certainty. The purpose is, rather, to have a set of\nindicators that give an “alert” to situations that pose a high risk of non-sustainability.\nWhatever we do, however, dashboards and indices are only one part of the story. Most of the\nefforts involved in assessing sustainability focus on increasing our knowledge about how the\neconomy and the environment interact now and are likely to interact in the future.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\nII.  Substantial  Arguments  \npresented in the  Report\nCHAPTER 1 : GDP RELATED ISSUES\nCHAPTER 2 : QUALITY OF LIFE\nCHAPTER 3 : SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT\n\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n CHAPTER 1  -  GDP RELATED ISSUES\n1 - Introduction\n1.\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the most widely used measure of economic activity.\nThere are international standards for its calculation and much thought has gone into its\nstatistical and conceptual bases. But GDP is a measure of mainly market production (products\nthat are either exchanged through market transactions or produced with inputs purchased on\nthe market), and thus more geared to measure the aggregate supply side of economies than the\nliving standards of its citizens. Although GDP levels are correlated with many indicators of\nliving standards, the correlation is not universal and tends to become  weaker when particular\nsectors of the economy are concerned. For example, real household income – an income\nmeasure which is more closely related to living standards – has evolved quite differently from\nGDP growth in a number of OECD countries. Too much emphasis on GDP as the unique\nbenchmark can lead to misleading indications about how well-off people are and run the risk\nof leading to the wrong policy decisions. The purpose of this chapter is to go beyond GDP in\nour quest for better economic measures of living standards. At the same time we shall be\nlooking for indicators that remain within the broad boundaries of a national accounting\nframework.\n 2.\nIn the quest for such indicators, we shall encounter a tension between the conceptual\nsoundness of some measures and the ease by which they can be implemented and\ncommunicated to users of the data. For example, conceptual considerations might lead us\ntowards inclusive measures of income, taking into account services that households ‘deliver\nto themselves’ such as child care, cooking or parents’ education services to children. At the\nsame time, such variables are hard to quantify and statisticians have to make more or less\nreliable imputations. Too many assumptions risk undermining the usefulness of an index. But\nignoring these elements may also impair the relevance of these measures.    \n3.\nWe accommodate the tension between inclusiveness and measurability in several ways.\nFirst, the chapter is structured in terms of increasing inclusiveness, starting out with measures\nbased on a relatively narrow market boundary and moving towards broader indicators of\nliving standards. It will be shown that even within the narrow market boundary there are\nmeasures that do a better job than GDP in tracking how well off citizens are. We shall also\npoint out where measurement can be improved through additional research and empirical\ninvestigation, thus helping to reduce the trade-offs mentioned earlier. \n4.\nSecond, we take a pragmatic stance. The simplest approach consists of complementing\nexisting indicators with additional indicators covering neglected dimensions of well-being,\nwithout necessarily attempting to rigorously aggregate all these dimensions into a single\nsummary index of living standards. For example, the monetary valuation of non-market\nactivity of households is fraught with uncertainty. But useful insights can be gained by\nanalysing (relatively reliable) data on how people use their time. Such time use data can show\nhow household activities change over time, how they differ between countries and how\nwomen’s use of time is different from men’s. More comprehensive, non-monetary indicators\n\n86\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nof the quality of life complement the picture and these are dealt with in a different part of the\npresent report.  \n5.\nThird, some issues are cross-cutting and will be taken up in several places of the text. In\nparticular, the question of income (and wealth) distribution is equally pertinent from a\nperspective that focuses on market income and one that takes a more comprehensive\napproach. \n6.\nA point of terminology: the present chapter focuses on material standards of living\nwhich are based on measures of income, consumption or wealth, typically expressed in\nmonetary terms. These are best understood as one of the determinants of overall well-being of\npeople or of their “human capabilities”.1  \n2 - The background: GDP, prices and living standards\n2.1. The role of market prices\n7.\nThe starting point for measuring economic performance is market transactions. A\nfundamental merit of market transactions is that they provide ‘objective’ prices that serve to\nvalue quantities of goods and services, making it possible to add up ‘apples’ and ‘oranges’.\nMacro-economic and fiscal policies require monitoring of market transactions. Indeed,\ncurrent metrics originated out of an attempt to monitor market production, following the\ndevelopment of Keynesian economics2.\n8.\nWhen markets are competitive and in the absence of externalities, relative prices of\ngoods and services mirror the relative values that individuals puts on these commodities. So,\nin principle, weighting products with their prices implies weighting them with their value for\neach individual in society. In addition, economic theory (Weitzman 1976) tells us that, in a\nworld where all transactions take place in competitive markets and where economic well-\nbeing depends only on consumption of marketed goods, changes in net domestic product\n(NDP, i.e. GDP adjusted for depreciation) are a good gauge of changes in economic well-\nbeing: this holds because an individual’s or a country’s ‘wealth’ can be viewed as the present\ndiscounted value of consumption. Under these conditions, NDP turns out to be like an interest\npayment (a ‘return’) on this wealth. This establishes – albeit under restrictive conditions – a\ndirect link between NDP and economic well-being. It also constitutes the basic framework for\nconsiderations about sustainability. \n 9.\nIn reality, prices may not exist for some goods and services and, even where they exist,\nthey may deviate from society’s underlying valuation. In particular, in the presence of\nexternalities, GDP, and indeed pure market-based measures, will not track well-being.\nEnvironmental damage caused by production or consumption activities that is not reflected in\nmarket prices is a well-known example for a negative externality.\n1.\nThe latter are captured, for example, in the work by Krueger et al. (2008) or by Sen (1985).\n2.\nKeynes (1940) undertook national income calculations, using earlier work by Colin Clarke, with a view to\nanalysing the effects of wartime expenditure and inflation. Meade and Stone (1941) present a more complete\nversion of income, expenditure, savings and investment accounts. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n87\n10.\nWhile it is straightforward to talk about ‘prices’ and ‘quantities’ in theory, defining and\nmeasuring prices and quantities in practice is altogether a different matter. Two variables are\nobserved by statisticians: the value of transactions (i.e. the product of prices and quantities);\nand the prices for different types of products, which are used to construct price indices. In\nmany instances, these price indices are used to ‘deflate’ values and to obtain a measure of\n‘volume’ or ‘quantity’. However, constructing price indices is only possible if the products\nwhose prices are observed do not change over time – otherwise like would not be compared\nwith like. As it happens, many products change over time – they disappear entirely or new\nfeatures are added to them. In other words, there is quality change and it can be very rapid in\nareas like information and communication technologies. And there are products whose\nquality is complex, multi-dimensional and hard to measure such as medical services,\neducation services, research activities or financial services. \n11.\nCapturing quality change correctly is a tremendous challenge for statisticians and yet it\nis vital to measure real income and real consumption, some of the key determinants of\npeople’s well-being. Under-estimating quality improvements is equivalent to over-estimating\nthe rate of inflation and under-estimating real income. For instance, a report reviewing the\nmeasurement of inflation in the United States (Boskin Commission Report) estimated that\ninsufficient accounting for quality improvement of goods and services led to an annual over-\nestimation of inflation by 0.6%. Since then, the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics – the agency\nresponsible for the CPI – has followed up with a series of measures to address the issues\nraised by the Boskin Commission. A more recent report by the Panel on Conceptual,\nMeasurement, and other Statistical Issues in Developing Cost-of-Living Indexes (Schultze\nand Mackie 2002) devotes significant space to the quality change and new goods problem in\nthe U.S. consumer price index. \n12.\nThe debate in Europe has tended to go the opposite way, in particular following the\nintroduction of the Euro: official measures of inflation (Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and\nothers) have been criticized for under-estimating inflation, thereby painting too rosy a picture\nof the real income situation of citizens. Capturing quality change in prices and volumes is a\nrecurring issue (see the discussion on government-provided services in section 2.1) without a\nsingle methodological solution.3\n13.\nA more subtle issue arises in conjunction with market power. When price discrimination\nby firms with market power increases, these firms’ profits will rise. What is not measured by\nconventional economic statistics is the loss in consumer surplus that households face. The\neffect of imperfect competition on the reliability of GDP to gauge real living standards of\nconsumers is difficult to determine and can only be assessed in a general equilibrium setting,\nwhere both changes in volumes and substitution effects by consumers are taken into account.\nSimilar conceptual issues are posed by profits that are generated by abusive practices, e.g.\nexploiting consumer ignorance. Most likely, the loss of consumer well-being exceeds the\nprofit gain of firms; while the latter are captured in our GDP measure, the former are not.\n14.\n The proportion of goods and services that come along with externalities may change\nover time and differ across countries. Thus, in temporal and spatial comparisons, price signals\nhave to be interpreted with care. For a number of purposes, they do not always provide a\nuseful vehicle for aggregation of quantities: a case in point is the use of market prices in\n3.\nFor an authoritative overview of quality-adjustment techniques see Triplett (2006).\n\n88\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\ncalculations of sustainability indicators and more is said about this in another chapter of this\nreport. \n2.2. The role of imputations\n15.\nWhile market prices and observed market transactions form the centre piece of\nmeasures of economic activity, GDP does not stop at those and, indeed, the System of\nNational Accounts includes a range of income, expenditure and production items that do not\nreflect market transactions. These non-market transactions are generally based on\nimputations, as leaving them out would provide a biased picture of economic activity and\ndistort comparisons across countries and over time. Some of these imputations bring GDP and\nincome measures closer to an economically meaningful gauge of living standards. \n16.\nImputations come, however, at a price. Imputations allow attributing a value to\nproduction, income or consumption even when there is no or no explicit economic\ntransaction. The main reason4 for imputing values is comprehensiveness of measures. Some\nof these imputations (such as imputed rents, see below) have been incorporated into GDP.\nThis is not the case for depreciation, for instance, an imputation to account for the loss of\nvalue of capital used in production and needed to move from GDP to Net Domestic Product\n(NDP). Some imputed transactions take place within the market sphere but are implicit and\nimplicitly-priced, such as financial intermediation services (FISIM – see below). Other\ntransactions are explicit and the imputation consists in attributing them to somewhere else in\nthe economy (individual consumption of goods and services provided by government - see\nbelow). Leaving out these imputations would mean accepting a very incomplete picture of\neconomic activity.5 \n17.\nAnother consequence of imputations is that they help preserving the “invariance\nprinciple” for national accounts. This suggests that the value of main accounting aggregates\nshould not depend on the institutional arrangements in a country. For example, if the same\nmedical services can be provided by either the public or the private sector, overall production\nshould be unaffected by a switch between the two institutional settings. The invariance\nprinciple increases comparability, over time and between countries.  \n18.\nIn the present system of national accounts, the most important imputations are:\n• Individual consumption of goods and services provided by government: these goods\nand services when provided for free (essentially health and education services) are not\npart of households' consumption expenditures because they are not directly paid by\nhouseholds. Of course, households pay for these services in the form of taxes or social\n4.\nNote that the national accounts also rely on a number of statistical imputations. For example, enterprise\nsurveys are rarely complete and imputations must be made for units not covered in the sample. Or imputations\nhave to be made to deal with non-response by units that have been surveyed. In these cases, economic transactions\ndo occur. Statistical imputations are only needed to correctly estimate their value.\n5.\nDepending on the institutional context, imputations tend to be more or less intensely debated. The topic is,\nfor instance, important in Europe where national accounts data are used for administrative purposes for example to\ndetermine countries’ financial contributions to the budget of the European Union or to allocate regional aid flows.\nAll these operations require comparable and reliable figures. Some experts argue that the use of imputations should\nbe minimised in this context so as to maximise reliability. Others support the idea of using imputations to reduce\nthe impact of institutional differences on the comparability of results.  \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n89\ncontributions, and measures of disposable income reflect such payments. But if these\npayments are deducted from household income, it would make sense to also add the\nvalue of goods and services to households’ income and consumption. The latter\nadjustment is not included in conventional measures of household income and\nexpenditures, but is included (through imputations) in the “adjusted” measures\nrecommended by SNA (see Section 2.7). \n• Own-account production of goods and services by households: the value of all goods\nproduced by households for their own consumption is imputed in the national accounts.\nIn rich countries, this tends to be a small share of production and income, whereas the\nshare is larger in developing countries. Own-account goods include, for example, home-\ngrown agricultural products. Own-account services are excluded with one major\nexception, dwelling services ‘produced’ by owner-occupiers (i.e. imputed rents). Other\neconomic activities of households (cleaning, cooking, child care etc.) are simply\nomitted from the SNA definition; they will be discussed further in this report in the\nsection on broader measures of household production.\n• Financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM): only part of the\nservices provided by financial institutions is explicitly priced, for instance through fees\nfor deposit management. Other services, such as liquidity services or accounting\nservices that a customer receives when opening a current account, are often not invoiced\ndirectly. Payment takes place indirectly, through interests paid to depositors are lower\nthan market interest rates so that the interest margin constitutes the implicit price of the\nservice rendered. This affects cross-county comparisons, as what may be implicitly\npriced in one country may be explicitly priced in another. Pricing may also change\nwithin a country over time. Hence, by making an imputation for these implicitly priced\nservices, the overall value of financial services is invariant to changes in the pricing\nsystem or to differences in the pricing system between countries. A practical difficulty\nconsists in allocating the overall amount of FISIM to the different sectors in the\neconomy – in particular households and corporations. \n• Consumption of non-life insurance services: insurance premiums paid by households\nand firms comprise a payment into the ‘insurance pool’, which serves to settle claims,\nand a payment for the service that the insurance company provides by managing\npremiums and claims (e.g. by advising customers in their choice of policy). Broadly\nspeaking, national accounts separate the two elements by assuming that the value of the\ninsurance service corresponds to whatever is left after claims have been deducted from\npremiums. This (imputed) insurance service is considered in the SNA as a consumption\nitem for households. Its measurement is fraught with difficulties.\n19.\nImputations are more or less sizeable, depending on the country and on the national\naccounts aggregate considered. The table below indicates that the main imputations account\nfor about one third of adjusted disposable income of households in two European countries\n(France and Finland) and for just over 20% in the United States. Thus, the living standards of\nFrench and Finnish households would be understated relative to the United States in the\nabsence of imputations. Figure 1 Imputations in household income and consumption in\nFrance, 20071 provides a more detailed picture for France, and relates data on imputations to\n\n90\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nboth income and consumption. As it turns out, about 20 % of the final consumption\nexpenditure figure for France can be attributed to the types of imputations described above6.  \nFigure 1 Imputations in household income and consumption in France, 2007\n20.\nBut imputations come at a price. One is data accuracy: imputed values tend to be less\nreliable than observed values because they often require assumptions about implicit\ntransactions. The other is the effect of imputations on the comprehensibility of national\naccounts. Not all of these imputations will be easily understood. For example, people may not\nrecognize the value of owner-occupied housing services as income, and the result may be a\ndiscrepancy between the changes in perceived and the changes in measured income. This\nproblem is reinforced when the scope of economic activity is widened to include other\nservices that are not mediated by the market. Our estimates below for household work amount\nto around 30% of conventionally-measured GDP. And another 80% or so are added when\nleisure is valued as well. It is undesirable to have assumption-driven data so massively\ninfluencing overall aggregates. \nTable 1 Major imputed and non-imputed components of adjusted disposable\n household income *\nSource: OECD Annual National Accounts.\n* Only financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) are imputed. Data available at the OECD do not allow\ndistinguishing between FISIM and other financial services.\n6.\nBy their very nature, there is some uncertainty associated with imputed values. Part of it reflects differences\nin methods to derive imputations, for example for owner-occupied rents. See Diewert and Nakamura (2009) for a\nrecent discussion.\n1985\n2007\n1985\n2007\n1985\n2006\nIm puted rents\n6.9%\n10.1%\n8.8%\n10.1%\n9.2%\n12.2%\nFinancial services including FISIM\n3.3%\n1.5%\n2.9%\n4.3%\n1.9%\n2.3%\nSocial transfers in kind\n17.3%\n19.0%\n7.9%\n8.3%\n19.5%\n22.3%\nTotal im putations\n27.4%\n30.6%\n19.6%\n22.8%\n30.6%\n36.8%\nO ther disposable incom e (not im puted)\n72.6%\n69.4%\n80.4%\n77.2%\n69.4%\n63.2%\nTotal adjusted disposable incom e\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nFrance\nUSA\nFinland\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nDisposable income Final consumption \nexpenditure\nAdjusted \ndisposable income\nActual final \nconsumption\nNon‐imputed\nImputed rents\nOwn‐account production of goods\nFISIM\nNon‐life insurance services\nSocial transfers in kind\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n91\n21.\nThe usefulness of including certain imputations into income and consumption statistics\nmay depend on the countries considered. Deaton (2005) discusses the main income items that\nare imputed in the national accounts but absent from household surveys: imputed rents for\nowner-occupied dwellings and financial intermediation services indirectly measured. In India,\nthe value of FISIM increased from close to zero in 1983/84 to 2.5 percent of consumption in\n1993/94, accounting for a quarter of a percentage point per year of the difference in annual\ngrowth rates between national accounts and survey consumption data. Deaton questions\nwhether, from the perspective of the poor, much of these financial intermediation services are\nrelevant for their living standards. As average income or consumption as measured through\nthe national accounts tends to grow more rapidly than measures drawn from household\nsurveys, there is a danger that SNA measures paint too rosy a picture of the income and\nconsumption of the poor if they benefit disproportionally from the items captured by\nimputations7. It may thus be that statistical procedures in poor countries “understate the rate\nof global poverty reduction, and overstate growth in the world.” (Deaton 2005).\n22.\nIn developed countries, the picture may be different. In France, for instance, the share of\nFISIM in total disposable income is small (between 1 and 2%) and has hardly changed since\nthe 1960s. The share of imputed rents, on the other hand, moved between 5% and 10% of\ndisposable income since 1960. This reflects fluctuations of the prices of rents more than a\nsteady trend. Similarly, the share of social transfers in kind in adjusted disposable income has\nrisen steadily in France.  \n23.\nThere is no easy way out of the tension between comprehensiveness and\ncomprehensibility except making available to users both elements of information, and\ndistinguishing between core and satellite accounts. A comprehensive household accounts, for\nexample (see below), may not be well placed within the core national accounts system, but\ncould be developed as a satellite account, providing a comprehensive valuation of\ncomprehensive forms of household production. \n3 - A first step: emphasizing national accounts aggregates other than GDP  \n3.1. Taking account of depreciation and depletion\n24.\nGDP is a measure of the amount of final goods and services produced within a country\nin a year (or a quarter). Gross output measures take no account of depreciation of capital\ngoods. But if a large amount of output produced has to be set aside to renew machines and\nother capital goods, society’s ability to consume is less than it would have been if only a small\namount of set-aside were needed. Thus, an immediate adjustment to GDP is to account for\ndepreciation; doing so, leads to a measure of net domestic product (NDP). Thus, net\nmeasures should be emphasized over gross measures of economic activity when the\nobjective is to track standards of living. \n7.\nThere are many factors to explain the lower growth of survey-based household income and consumption.\nOne is that richer households are less likely to participate in surveys. A second factor is that the national accounts'\nmeasures of household income and consumption contain several important and rapidly growing items that are not\nconsumed by the poor and that are not included in surveys. So it is possible for consumption of the poor to grow\nless rapidly than national consumption, without any increase in measured inequality.\n\n92\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n25.\nThe reason why economists have relied more heavily on GDP than on NDP is, in part,\nthat depreciation is hard to estimate. True economic depreciation is the change in the value of\ncapital goods as a result of its wearing out or obsolescence8 and the shortening of its future\nlifespan. But most businesses (and, often, national accountants) use simple rules: if a machine\nwears out on average in ten years, each year’s depreciation is estimated to be one-tenth of the\nvalue of the machine. When the structure of production remains the same, GDP and NDP\nmove closely together. Then, although we know that GDP overestimates the level of net\noutput, percentage changes in GDP tended to provide a good measure of changes in NDP. But\nin recent years, the structure of production has changed. Information technology (IT) assets\nhave become more important, and they account for a higher share of all capital goods. Life\nexpectancy of computers and software is also shorter than of steel mills. On those grounds,\nthe discrepancy between GDP and NDP should be increasing, and by implication, volume\nNDP should rise less rapidly than GDP. For example, nominal GDP in the United States rose\nby 6.1% per year during the period 1995-2007. The value of consumption of fixed capital (the\nnational accountants’ term for depreciation) rose by 6.9% over the same period. As a\nconsequence, nominal NDP grows at a slower rate (6.0%) than GDP. These differences are\nsmall at the level of the entire economy but can be larger for individual industries.9\n26.\nOf greater concern for some countries is that the standard measures of NDP have not\ntaken into account the degradation in quality of the natural environment. The System of\nNational Accounts foresees entries for the appearance and disappearance of natural economic\nassets as well as for the quality change in these assets due to economic uses. Thus, the\ndegradation of land, water resources and other natural assets from economic activity is in\ntheory recorded, as is the depletion of subsoil resources, as long as these natural assets qualify\nas economic assets (i.e. ownership rights can be exerted). Environmental resources that do not\nqualify as economic “assets” (such as air or biodiversity) are thus excluded from the\nmeasurement of degradation.10 \n27.\nEven for those natural resources that are recognized as economic assets, measures of\ndepletion are rarely available in statistical practice, and where they exist, these entries do not\nshow up as a charge against income: they are rather treated as a reduction in the quantity of\nassets held, just as one would treat the loss of a building due to an earthquake – a capital loss,\n8.\nObsolescence can be related either to technological advances, or simply to changes in factor prices.  As\nwages rise, machines that require high inputs of labour become less valuable.  Technological obsolescence is\nobviously of central importance for many high tech investments, which are assuming an increasing large share of\nGDP.  \n9.\nWe have expressed the comparison between net and gross product in nominal terms because it is not\nimmediately obvious how to interpret a volume or quantity change of depreciation or net product. A volume\nchange of GDP can be relatively easily characterized as the volume change of all the final goods and services\nproduced in the economy over a given accounting period. Depreciation is a charge against income and reflects a\nvalue loss of capital goods used in production that can be expressed in equivalent units of new capital goods but\nthis is only one possibility. From a perspective of material standards of living, it is better to reason in terms or real\nnet domestic income: the amount of resources generated during the period and expressed in equivalents of\n(consumption) goods or services. There are different ways to express real income – consumption product\nequivalents are most frequently used for household income whereas products of domestic demand are typically\nused as the equivalent ‘unit’ in which economy-wide real income is expressed. \n10.\nEnvironment resources are not the only non-marketed assets which play an important role in determining\nsocietal well-being. Health, human capital, and knowledge are other assets that are at least partially non-marketed.\nSee the discussion below.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n93\nbut not a reduction in income. From an accounting point of view, two solutions can be\nimagined. First, the depletion of natural resources could be captured by excluding the value of\nnatural resources from the production value of sectors like mining and timber. Their\nproduction would then only consist in a pure extraction or logging activity with a\ncorresponding decrease in GDP. A second possibility is to take resource depletion into\naccount in the depreciation measures. In this case, GDP would be unchanged but NDP would\nbe lower. The hurdle is reliable monetary valuation of the natural resource that accounts for\nchanges to environmental quality\n28.\nA related question is how to treat additions to the stocks of natural resources. In\nprinciple, accounting should be symmetric: just as natural resources are reduced by\nextraction, they should increase with additions. For biological resources, this addition\nhappens through natural growth. For subsoil reserves of minerals and energy, the known stock\nmay rise as the result of mineral exploration and appraisal. Others would maintain that the\nstock of sub-soil assets is non-renewable on a human scale. If, and how much of such\nadditions to stocks should be recognized as an addition to income, has been a matter of\ndebate.\n29.\nNone of the issues arising from the recognition of depletion and environmental\ndegradation in the national accounts are new, and much work on these issues has been\nundertaken at the national and at the international level, as demonstrated for example by the\nInternational Handbook on Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA -\n2003), or by the ongoing work of the ‘London Group’, a gathering of statisticians who deal\nwith the environment and economics. There are some conceptual problems (such as those\nalluded to in the previous paragraph), many measurement problems (especially concerning\nenvironmental degradation), and occasional political problems. Taking into account resource\ndepletion would, for instance, suggest a smaller weight for sectors like coal mining and\ntimber in the economy; and, in some instance, there has been lobbying against the\ndevelopment of more comprehensive accounts that would reflect resource depletion and\nadverse environmental effects. Further issues are posed by internationally harmonized\nimplementation11. \n30.\nWhen the use of natural resources is not recognised as a cost of production, there is less\nincentive to use these resources optimally. If services provided by natural assets are shown,\nresource productivity – i.e. the efficiency with which natural resources are used – can be\ntracked and put on the same footing as measures of labour productivity or (produced) capital\nproductivity. Work has progressed in this area12 but much remains to be done before\ncomparable measures of resource efficiency are available for a broad number of countries. \n3.2. Domestic and national income  \n31.\nAlthough we have been referring to net product, it is more relevant (from a perspective\nof economic well-being) to refer to net income. ‘Product’ relates to the supply side of the\neconomy whereas ‘income’ refers to the ultimate purpose of production, namely use for\n11.\nThe United Nations Committee on Economic and Environmental Accounts (UNCEEA) is supervising the\nwork in this area, with the aim of elevating the SEEA Handbook to a statistical standard.\n12.\nFor example, OECD Countries recently signed up to a resolution in this area; see www.oecd.org/\nenvironment/resourceefficiency \n\n94\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nconsumption and higher standards of living. In what follows, we shall therefore reason in\nterms of ‘income’ rather than ‘product’. When turning to real income as opposed to its money\nvalue, a question arises on how to deflate nominal values. Whereas ‘product’ is typically\nexpressed as the quantity or volume of goods and services produced, real income expresses\nthe quantity of products that can be purchased with a given sum of money income. Before\nturning to the measurement of real income, additional adjustments will be discussed that can\nbe brought to the measure of net (nominal or monetary) income.  \n32.\nGlobalization may lead to large differences between measures of the income of a\ncountry and measures of its production. The former is more relevant to peoples’ living\nstandards because some of the income generated in production by residents is sent abroad,\nand some residents receive income from abroad. Consequently, a more relevant measure than\nGDP and NDP, in our search for a measure of living standards, is net national disposable\nincome (NNDI, see Box 1). This measure accounts for payments and receipts of income to\nand from abroad13.  This too is a standard variable in countries’ national accounts. \nFigure 2: Net national disposable income as percentage of gross domestic product\n33.\nAs production shifts from manufacturing to services, the differences between GDP and\nNNDI has increased in some countries. This affects the judgments of how well off people are.\nAssume, for instance, that more and more production occurs inside a country by firms owned\nabroad. While the profits generated by these firms are included in GDP, they do not enhance\nthe spending power of the citizens of the country. For citizens of a poor developing country, to\nbe told that GDP has gone up may be of little relevance; they want to know about their own\nliving standards. This is especially the case in those countries relying heavily on mining or\noil, which may receive a small royalty but where most of the returns accrue to the\nheadquarters of a multinational company. Even among relatively wealthy OECD countries,\nthe gap between NNDI and GDP can be of importance, as Figure 2: Net national disposable\nincome as percentage of gross domestic product2 shows in the case of Ireland. There, the\ndeclining share of NNDI in GDP reflects the large foreign direct investments in the economy\n13.\nFor the  treatment of international capital flows in national see Box 2.\n70.0\n75.0\n80.0\n85.0\n90.0\n95.0\nFrance\nUSA\nIreland\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n95\nand the large profits that are transferred outside of Ireland. By this measure, Irish income has\nincreased by less than GDP growth would have suggested.\n34.\nChanges in standards of living are determined by changes in both money income and\nprices of products that can be acquired with a given sum of money. One key determinant of\nreal income is the relative price of foreign products, that is the rate at which exports may be\ntraded against imports from the rest of the world (terms of trade). When a country’s export\nprices rise more quickly than the prices of its imports, the country’s citizens are better off and\nvice versa. Such gains or losses in the terms of trade can be important for small open\neconomies, in particular when exports or imports are clustered around particular product\ngroups. They are particularly important for small countries that export oil or other mineral\nresources but import a significant part of consumption.\n Box 1. National Income and National Disposable Income - Two different concepts\nAlthough national income (NI) and national disposable income (NDI) both refer to the income of the\nwhole economy, NDI is a more comprehensive aggregate than NI. NI takes into account international\ntransfers associated with the compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports, subsidies on\nproducts and production, and property income (interest payments, dividends , property income distributed\nto insurance policy holders, rents). NI is the starting point for computing NDI: to NI are added\ninternational transfers concerning current taxes on income and wealth, social contributions, social benefits\nin cash, and other current transfers from and to the rest of the world (e.g. non-life insurance premiums,\nnon-life insurance claims, current international cooperation or current transfers between households). \nThe difference between NI and NDI hence reflects an element of income distribution between sectors.\nThis is best explained by applying the concept to a household. A household’s (primary) income consists of\nwages and property income such as dividends received. But households have to pay taxes and social\ncontributions and they may receive social benefits and transfer payments. Accounting for these\ntransactions leads to measures of disposable income. At the level of the whole economy, taxes, social\nsecurity payments and so on that take place inside the country cancel out; but current transfers from and to\nother countries do not, and the difference between them mark the difference between NI and NDI. Thus,\nNDI better measures how well off citizens are. \nBoth NI and NDI can be computed gross or net of depreciation. As mentioned elsewhere, for the\npurpose at hand, net measures are conceptually preferable to gross measures.\n35.\nTaking these changes in relative prices into account, along with real international\ntransfers and real depreciation, yields a measure of real net national income for the entire\neconomy. The figures below show that there is little to report home about the difference\nbetween constant price GDP and real net disposable income for some countries – the United\nStates and France being cases in point. However, the example from Norway suggests that\ninternational price changes can drive a significant wedge between volume GDP and real\nincome.14,15 Norway’s economy and real income benefited enormously from rising oil prices\n14.\nTerms-of-trade effects can be worked into real income comparisons more systematically. The methodology\nfor such measures has been worked out by Diewert and Morrison (1986), Kohli (1991) and Diewert et al. (2005)\nwith the first application of the decomposition method to Australia in Diewert and Lawrence (2006). For a\ncomprehensive treatment of terms-of-trade measurement, see IMF et al. (2009). \n15.\nFor each country, the deflator of net domestic demand (i.e.: final consumption + net capital formation) has\nbeen used to compute real income.\n\n96\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nuntil 2008, allowing Norwegians to buy more imports for the same amount of oil exported.\nThis is reflected in the more rapid rise of real net disposable income compared to that of GDP\nat constant prices. The measurement effect comes through because real NNDI is obtained by\napplying a price index for final domestic demand (final consumption and investment), part of\nwhich is imported. Note, however, that the ‘net’ calculation that underlies the Norwegian\nincome measure does not reflect the depletion of Norwegian subsoil resources.   \nFigure 3: GDP and disposable income in the USA and in France\nFigure 4: GDP and disposable income in Norway\nSource: OECD Annual National Accounts.\n36.\nJust as real income and volume GDP can be compared over time for a particular\ncountry, real income and volume GDP can be compared across countries at a particular point\nin time. Feenstra et al.

National accounting treatment of international capital flows \nGlobalization entails not only more imports and exports of goods and services but also more\ninternational capital flows. Inflows and outflows of foreign capital are financial transactions that do not by\nthemselves affect GDP. The impact on GDP is only indirect, for example through the investment\nexpenditures that the international financial flows allow to finance. The same is true for outflows of\nforeign capital from a country: they impact on GDP only in the sense that some investment expenditures\ninside the country may be postponed or cancelled.\nHowever, where foreign financial investments are important, national income may evolve differently\nfrom national product, as has for instance been the case in Ireland since the beginning of the 1990s.There is\na special treatment of the income flows associated with foreign direct investments (FDI). These constitute\ninvestments of a long-term nature as opposed to ‘portfolio investments’ that are of a more short-term\nnature. The treatment of FDI is best explained by way of an example. Say there is a firm with its\nheadquarters in country A (firm A) and it opens a subsidiary in country B (firm B). The following\naccounting treatment occurs:\n•\nWhen the subsidiary is created, the flow of cash from firm A is recorded as a purchase by A of the\nshares or equity issued by B. This purchase constitutes a financial transaction. The cash received by B\nmay then be used to finance a production line or a building. Only these transactions are recorded as\nformation of fixed capital, and they increase investment and GDP of country B.  \n•\nNow suppose that firm B earns profits and repatriates part of them back to firm A. The repatriated\nprofits are property income for firm A and so they raise country A’s national income. In fact, and by\nconvention, national accounts count all of B’s profits as property income (hence of national income)\nfor country A. The imputed flow – the profits that are not repatriated – is recorded under the heading\n\"reinvested earnings on foreign direct investment\" in the national accounts. What is the overall\nconsequence of this treatment? GDP of countries A and B is unaffected – all of the profits generated by\nthe subsidiary are simply part of GDP in country B. However, the national income of country A will\nincrease by an amount equal to total profits and the national income of country B will decrease by the\nsame amount. This effect is independent of the extent to which profits have actually been repatriated or\nreinvested. \n•\nBut the story does not end here. Another flow, equivalent in amount to ‘reinvested earnings’, is entered\nas a financial transaction between the two countries. The reinvested profits are treated as if country A\npurchased more equity in country B. This is tantamount to saying that investments of firm B are\nalways financed through the emission of new shares or a rise in equity rather than self-financed.\nNow assume that firm B just accumulates retained earnings rather than purchasing capital goods with\nthem. After several years of sitting in a bank account in country B, the cumulated profits are sent back to\nthe mother company A. There is now neither an effect on GDP, nor on GNI and GNDI, of any of the\ncountries. The transfer of cumulated profits is recorded as a sale of shares or equity and a transfer of\ncurrency, that is, as a financial transaction. Similarly, if firm A decides to sell its participation in firm B,\nthe only direct consequence is for the financial accounts of countries A and B.\nThe treatment of reinvested earnings is an example of how imputations help reducing the dependence\nof income measures on specific institutional arrangements and accounting decisions of corporations.\n  \n3.3. Services in general and government-provided services in particular\n37.\nIn today’s economies, services account for up to two thirds of total production and\nemployment. At the same time, measuring the prices and volumes of services is more difficult\nthan for goods. Retail services are a case in point. In principle, many aspects should be taken\ninto account in the measurement of the services provided: the volume of goods transacted but\nalso the quality of service (accessibility of the shop, general service level of the staff, choice\nand presentation of products and so forth). It is difficult to even define these services, let alone\nmeasuring them. Statistical offices generally use data on the volume of sales as indicators for\nthe volume of trade services. This method leaves aside most quality change in the trade\nservices provided. What is true for retail holds for many other service industries, including\n\n98\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nthose that are often publicly provided such as health and education. More efforts will be\nneeded to get to grips with tracking the quantity and quality of services in modern economies. \n38.\nServices provided by government are of particular interest. Broadly speaking,\ngovernment provides two types of services – those of a collective nature, such as security, and\nthose of an individual nature, such as medical services or education. This does not imply that\ngovernment is necessarily the only provider of these services and indeed, the mix between\nprivate and public provision of individual services varies significantly across countries.\nEducation and health services are by far the most important individual services and their\navailability, accessibility and quality play a tremendous role in people’s lives. Health and\neducation are large sectors in most economies but their output tends to be badly measured.\nTraditionally, the output of government-provided non-market services is measured based on\nthe inputs used to produce these services16. For clarity of the discussion to follow, two\ndistinctions are helpful. \n39.\nThe first one is between the values and volumes of government-provided services. The\nsecond distinction is between the health and education system at large and the institutions that\nprovide health and education services. The usefulness of both distinctions is best explained by\nway of an example. The United States spend more per capita on health care, and yet standard\nindicators of health outcomes are worse than in many European countries. Does this mean\nthat Americans get less health care output? Or does it mean health care in the US is more\nexpensive and/or delivered less efficiently? Or does it mean that health outcomes also depend\non factors specific to the American society other than health expenditures? The distinction\nbetween values and volumes answer precisely this question. Over time, or across countries,\nwe need to break down the change (or the difference across countries) in health expenditures\ninto a price and a volume effect. But what exactly are the volumes that one is looking for? It is\ntempting to measure them by way of health or education outcomes, i.e., by the state of the\nhealth of the population or by the state of knowledge of pupils. The problem is that the link\nbetween expenditures and these outcomes is tenuous at best: expenditures relate to the\nresources that go into the institutions providing health and education services, whereas final\noutcomes (e.g. the health status of the population or the competencies of students) are driven\nby many factors. For example, people’s lifestyle will affect health outcomes, in the same way\nas the time parents spend with their children will affect exam scores. Cutler, Deaton and\nLleras-Muney (2006) examine causes for changes in mortality rates over time and they\nidentify a host of factors other than medical care that may have had as big an impact on\nmortality as health care per se. Attributing changes in the health or education status only to\nhospitals and schools (and to the money spent on them) neglects all these factors.    \n40.\nHow, then, are the values of government services measured in practice? The general\npractice used by most statistical offices is simply to add up costs linked to their provision. To\ninterpret this from a standard of living perspective means assuming that costs are optimally\nallocated. However, as Atkinson and Stiglitz point out, this assumption breaks down “…once\nwe recognise that government spending is financed by distortionary taxes. This has led some\npeople to conclude that public provision stops short and that therefore we should value the\n16.\nThere are exceptions. For example, final consumption expenditures for pharmaceutical products provided by\ngeneral government are based on product values. These are directly observed and do not have to be computed as\nthe sum of inputs like for medical services.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n99\noutput at an amount greater than the value of the inputs. However, we cannot say\ncategorically that the value should be greater (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1980, Lecture 16).” \n41.\nPrivately-provided services would seem to escape this problem but this is only partially\ntrue. Consider privately provided medical services. Under standard conditions, market prices\nreflect individuals’ marginal valuations of a good or service. But most purchases of health\nservices are paid for by third parties, by individuals who are relatively uninformed about the\nmarginal valuation: they are relying on other peoples’ judgments. Thus, even in the absence\nof quality changes, there would be little reason to assume that prices reflect marginal\nvaluations. Finally, in the area of health care, patients are constrained in their choice: while\nthere is some substitution between treatments for a particular disease, there is certainly no\nsubstitution between diseases. Therefore, relative prices of treatment of diseases are in no\nobvious way indicative of people’s preferences.\n42.\nTurning to the measurement of volumes of government-provided services, these have\ntraditionally been measured by the volumes of inputs and this is still the case in many\ncountries. For example, the number of nurses or physician-hours may have been used to\nmeasure the volume of medical care. An immediate consequence of this procedure is that\nmultifactor productivity change is ignored, as outputs are simply assumed to change at the\nsame rhythm as inputs.   \n43.\nThe quest is for more accurate measures of the volume growth of public services and\nwork has started. Many European countries as well as Australia and New Zealand have\ndeveloped output-based measures for government-provided services. A major challenge in\nthese efforts is capturing quality change. Without a good measure of quality (or, equivalently,\nof a good estimate of the increase in productivity) it is impossible to ascertain whether the\nconventional input measures under- or overestimate growth of these sectors. If\nundifferentiated quantity measures (such as the global overall number of students or of\npatients) are used, changes in the composition of output and in its quality may be missed. The\nultimate output of the education sector is the increased competencies of the students who are\neducated as a result in schools and universities; similarly, the ultimate output of the medical\nsector is the increased health status that results from medical care. In principle, quality change\nin the provision of these services could be gauged by the marginal contribution of medical\ncare (or education) to the health status (or to human capital), while controlling for all other\ninfluences. In practice, this is fraught with problems, because it is difficult to separate the\ninfluences of medical care or education services from other factors that impact on outcomes.\n44.\nUsing the (admittedly imperfect) output measures focusing on patients treated or\nstudents educated has important effects, and these effects go in different directions. For\nexample, with output-based measures, the U.K. economy grew at the rate of 2.75% per year\nbetween 1995 and 2003, whereas if the previous, input-based, convention had continued to be\nused, the growth rate would have been 3% (Atkinson 2005). Similarly, total economy value-\nadded for France between 2000 and 2006 grows at an average rate of 2.0% per year when\nusing an output method to compute volumes for non-market education and health, and of\n2.15% using an input method (Figure 5: Impact of output and input-based methods on total\nvalue-added, France5). The difference is mostly due to non-market education. \n\n100\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nFigure 5: Impact of output and input-based methods on total value-added, France\nSource: INSEE.\n45.\nTurning to the effects of output versus input methods on the evolution of households'\nreal disposable incomes, one finds annual differences of between 0.1 and 0.4 percentage\npoints per year. In France, most adjustments when moving from an input to an output method\nare downwards, i.e., measured household income in real terms over the period 2000-2006\ngrows more slowly when using an output-based measure for government provided services.\nThe effects, however, can also go in the opposite direction. 46. An important criterion for\nassessing the reliability of output-based measures is that they are based on observations that\nare detailed enough to avoid conflating true volume changes with compositional effects. For\nexample, if spending per student increases, one might conclude that the unit cost of education\nservices has increased. This may, however, be misleading if the higher costs result from\nstudents being taught in smaller classes, or if a larger share of students take up more costly\nengineering studies. The problem is that the number of students is a poor measure of output;\nbetter proxies of output are needed, for example by considering one hour taught to a graduate\nengineering student as a different product from one hour taught to a first year student in arts.\nIn so doing, we achieve a certain level of implicit quality adjustment and control for\ncompositional change. A similar reasoning applies for health care where the treatments of\ndifferent diseases have to be considered as different medical services. As it turns out, changes\nin health care administration in some countries have made available the administrative data\nneeded to obtain this detailed information. 6 shows measures of value-added for the Danish\nhealth sector. The input-based index rose significantly slower than the output-based index,\nwhich captures treatment of diseases. In other words, the Danish health care industry\nexperienced positive multifactor productivity growth. Measurement differences from the\nhealth care industry carry over – albeit with reduced strength – to total measures of\ngovernment production and GDP.  \n‐0.50%\n0.00%\n0.50%\n1.00%\n1.50%\n2.00%\n90.00\n95.00\n100.00\n105.00\n110.00\n115.00\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\nOutput‐based (left axis)\nInput‐based (left axis)\nDifference in annual growth of value added (right axis)\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n101\n46.\nAn important criterion for assessing the reliability of output-based measures is that they\nare based on observations that are detailed enough to avoid conflating true volume changes\nwith compositional effects. For example, if spending per student increases, one might\nconclude that the unit cost of education services has increased. This may, however, be\nmisleading if the higher costs result from students being taught in smaller classes, or if a\nlarger share of students take up more costly engineering studies. The problem is that the\nnumber of students is a poor measure of output; better proxies of output are needed, for\nexample by considering one hour taught to a graduate engineering student as a different\nproduct from one hour taught to a first year student in arts. In so doing, we achieve a certain\nlevel of implicit quality adjustment and control for compositional change. A similar reasoning\napplies for health care where the treatments of different diseases have to be considered as\ndifferent medical services. As it turns out, changes in health care administration in some\ncountries have made available the administrative data needed to obtain this detailed\ninformation.   \n47.\nIn addition to implicit quality adjustment through product differentiation, explicit\nquality adjustment may be called for and this is an important area of research. Explicit quality\nadjustments are very difficult to implement and typically micro-econometric studies are\nnecessary. At this juncture it is difficult to draw a general conclusion as to whether measured\nGDP growth slows or accelerates as a consequence of moving from an input to an output-\nbased method (see also OECD 2008a). While many empirical problems will have to be\naddressed before output-based volumes can be accurately measured, experience shows that\nprogress can be made. Better measurement of government-provided individual services is\ncentral to the assessment of living standards. Exploitation of new administrative sources to\ndeepen the level of information detail is one way of progressing in this direction. Lastly, the\ndevelopment of output-based measures of production does not dispense from improving the\naccuracy of the measures of inputs. Only if both inputs and outputs are adequately captured\ncan there be reliable productivity measurement.\nFigure 6: Volume output health care services in Denmark\nSource: Deveci, Heurlén and Sørensen (2008).\n100.0\n102.0\n104.0\n106.0\n108.0\n110.0\n112.0\n114.0\n116.0\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\nOutput‐based\nInput‐based\n\n102\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n3.4. Defensive expenditures\n48.\nExpenditures required to maintain consumption levels or the functioning of society\ncould be viewed as intermediate inputs – i.e. these expenditures confer no direct benefit.\nMany such ‘defensive expenditures’ are incurred by government, others are incurred by the\nprivate sector. For example, expenditure on prisons could be considered a government-\nincurred defensive expenditure, and expenditures on commuting to work are an example of\nprivately-incurred defensive expenditures. Several authors suggested treating these\nexpenditures as intermediate rather than final products, hence excluding them from GDP. \n \nBox 3. ‘Defensive expenditures’ in the literature\nIn 1939, John Hicks wrote that \"the services of police, justice and defence do contribute to production,\nand may be thought of as used in production in the same way as power and fuel\". By 1948, he reached the\nconclusion that a practical distinction between government activities which are final output and those\nwhich intermediate was feasible. Similarly, Kuznets (1951) considered that the expansion of government\nactivities after World War II was so important that national accountants had to distinguish between final\nand intermediate output. He proposed several criteria to identify \"the services by government to\nindividuals that result directly in a flow of goods to ultimate consumers\" and, therefore, had to be\nconsidered as final consumption:\nFirst, that \"the individual recipient of the service from government pays no price or only a token price\";\nSecond, that \"the government service be available to the individual only upon his overt initiative,\nrather than to him as a member of a social group who, as an individual, may be quite unaware of the\nservice\". \nThird, that \"the services by government to individuals have an analogue in the private markets\". So,\neducation, health, theaters and recreational activities may be included in final consumption of government\nservices, but not justice, police and defence. Services meeting this criterion have a \"widespread use\" in\nprivate markets. This is to ensure that, for instance, police activities are not considered as service to\nultimate consumers just because some people hire bodyguards on private markets. \nEisner (1988) argued along the same vein. He also pointed out an asymmetry: police services are\ncounted as final product when provided by government but not when purchased by a corporation. If a large\ncompany agrees with a municipality to provide for its own security services in return for a reduction in\nlocal taxes, this would be counted as intermediate consumption by the company. Then he notes: “The point\nmay well be made that police services, however useful or necessary, are in fact intermediate in nature no\nmatter who pays for them. The final output is always the goods and services being produced, and the police\nnecessary to protect them are simply a cost of that final output. Treating police services on this basis would\nenable us to avoid the anomaly of showing increases in real GNP as both crime and the police efforts to\nhold it in check rise apace.”  \nDefensive expenditures are not only limited to government activity. Nordhaus and Tobin’s (1973), for\nexample, identify as ‘defensive’ those activities that \"are evidently not directly sources of utility\nthemselves but are regrettably necessary inputs to activities that may yield utility\". As a result, they adjust\nincome downwards for expenditures that arise as a consequence of urbanization and a complex modern\nlife. This approach raises an issue of classifying certain goods and services as intermediate inputs rather\nthan as final products.\nEven when defensive expenditures are treated as final, the present report argues that some of the issues\ncan be addressed by treating them as investment products rather than as consumption goods, as will be\nexplained below. \n \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n103\n49.\nAt the same time, difficulties abound when it comes to identifying which expenditures\nare ‘defensive’, which are not and how to treat them in national accounts. What are possible\nways forward? Options include:\n• First, focus on household consumption rather than total consumption. For many\npurposes, this can be a meaningful variable. All of government consumption\nexpenditures (such as prisons, military expenditures or the clean-up of oil spills) are\nexcluded from households' final consumption. If one wants to capture ‘individual\nconsumption’ provided by government, the SNA measure of actual final household\nconsumption is appropriate because it captures these services provided by government\n(government ‘collective consumption’ is never imputed to households). This distinction\nbetween individual and collective consumption follows directly from the second criteria\nproposed by Kuznets (see Box) to distinguish between final and intermediate\nconsumption of government services.\n• Second, widening the asset boundary. An alternative solution would be to treat part of\nthese activities as an investment. In many cases, there are elements of investment and\ncapital goods in these defensive expenditures (as in the case of spending to remedy a\ndeterioration in environmental quality). In those cases, defensive expenditures could be\ntreated as maintenance expenditures: for example, expenditure on security could be\nregarded as an investment in social capital, and health expenditures as an investment in\nhuman capital. If there is an asset that captures environmental quality, expenditures\nmade to improve or to maintain it could also be considered as an investment.\nConversely, the consequences of economic activity that lower the quality or quantity of\nthat asset could be captured in an extended measure of depreciation or depletion so that\nthe net measure of income or production is reduced accordingly. Spending on pollution\nabatement reduces the adverse environmental effects—the benefits are realized in terms\nof a smaller deterioration in the quality of the environment that otherwise would occur.\n• Third, widening the household production boundary. Some ‘defensive’ expenditures\ncannot reasonably be treated as an investment. Take the case of commuting to work.\nHouseholds produce transportation services – they use their time (labor input) and their\ncar (capital input) for this purpose. With the exception of the consumer’s purchase of a\nticket for a commuter train, none of the above flows currently enter measures of\nproduction and income. This could be remedied by allowing for household production\nof transportation services17 that are provided as unpaid intermediate inputs to firms.\nBecause firms don’t actually pay for this input, a transfer from households to producers\nwould also have to be imputed. Under the new treatment, value-added would have been\nshifted from firms to households. While this provides more accurate information about\neach sector’s contribution to total value-added, it does not reduce GDP in the presence\nof commuting. \n50.\nOne consideration may help to decide whether collective non-market services provided\nby general government should be considered as intermediate consumption or as investment.\nBy definition, intermediate consumption is an input into production that is used up within the\naccounting period. Collective services like national defence or security are conditions of\n17.\nIn the case where employers provide, say a bus, to ensure transport of employees to work, this would be\nregistered as an intermediate input under present accounting conventions.\n\n104\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\neconomic activity but, clearly, they are not \"used up\" during the accounting period. Moreover,\nas non-rival and non-exclusive public goods, they can benefit many processes of production\nat one time. To this extent, collective services better fit the definition of an (intangible) fixed\nasset. In order to make clear that this type of assets can be used simultaneously by all agents\nin the economy, a notion of collective investment, indicating the propriety of society as a\nwhole on these assets, could be introduced.\n51.\nEven individual consumption of non-market services such as education could be treated\nas an investment undertaken by the individual. Methods to value human capital exist in the\neconomic literature (Jorgenson and Fraumeni 1989). The 1993 SNA treats expenditures on\neducation as final consumption.18 One reason is that other forms of personal investment\n(learning, studying…) contribute to the accumulation of the stock of human capital and they\nare not recorded as productive activities in the national accounts. Integrating them into the\nnational accounts is possible but would require developing a system of household production.\nWhile the theory of valuing human capital is well-developed, this is not necessarily the case\nfor other assets. As mentioned earlier, widening the asset boundary in national accounting\ncomes at the price of added imputations and many empirical difficulties. \n52.\nBut there is no conceptual reason not to go down this avenue. Treating some non-market\n‘defensive’ activities as an investment would have advantages:\n– It would allow taking into account interactions between economic output and the level\nof these assets. For example, the contribution of health capital to output (health is\nrelated to the productivity of workers) could be estimated. Conversely, health capital\ncould be explicitly affected by the conditions of production (for instance, industrial\npollution could contribute to the depreciation of health capital).\n– It would also help answering the criticism that an increase in defensive expenditures in\nresponse to, say, a deterioration of the state of security or the deterioration of the\nenvironment should not be recorded as an increase in the living standards. One could\nbetter distinguish the initial deterioration (which would appear negatively in the stock\naccount) from the activity of repairing this deterioration (which would appear positively\nin the flow account). This treatment would be coherent with the fact that, conditional on\ndamage having occurred, defensive expenditures do have a welfare enhancing effect.\n– Moreover, this modification would not affect the level of GDP. However, it would affect\nNDP, and measures of net income as should be the case because they are relevant for\nliving standards. More attention would be paid to balance sheets. Efforts along those\nlines would help develop better measures of sustainability, discussed later in this report.\n53.\nIn practice, changes in the statistical treatment of a given product (i.e. from intermediate\ninput to investment) have happened on a number of occasions. The most prominent is the\ntreatment of research and development expenditure (from intermediate input to a capital\ngood, see Box 4 below).\n18.\nThe SNA states that \"while knowledge, skills and qualifications are clearly assets in the broad sense of the\nterm, they cannot be equated with fixed assets as understood in the [SNA]. They are not produced because they are\nacquired through learning, studying and practising - activities that are not themselves processes of production. The\neducation services produced by schools, colleges, universities, etc. are consumed by students in the process of their\nacquiring knowledge and skills\" (1993 SNA, § 1.52).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n105\n54.\nThe biggest obstacle to these approaches lies in their implementation. What should be\nthe scope of defensive expenditures? How should the new assets and in-kind flows be valued?\nBy necessity, all accounting decisions would constitute simple conventions and the question\nremains whether the resulting data hides more than it reveals. That said, the questions around\n‘defensive expenditure’ constitute a vast and important field of more research of a conceptual\nand of an empirical nature.    \n Box 4. From intermediate input to investment: the case of intellectual property products\nThe borderline between intermediate consumption and gross fixed capital formation has been a matter\nof discussion and has changed over time as the international guidelines concerning intellectual property\nproducts. Examples of these products are research and development (R&D), mineral exploration, computer\nsoftware and entertainment, literary or artistic originals. \nUnder the 1993 SNA accounting standard, all expenditures in intellectual property products financed\nby corporations were treated as intermediate consumption. Government-financed R&D was treated as final\nconsumption but neither private nor public R&D was treated as an investment good.\nThe new 2008 SNA recognizes R&D as part of capital formation. The reason is simple: R&D activity\nleads to knowledge assets that are of increasing importance for firms and economies and which should be\nrecognized as such in the national accounts. A similar point can be made with regard to mineral\nexploration: it generates a stock of knowledge about reserves of subsoil assets. This shows that what is\nconsidered as an investment good or as an intermediate input is not cast in stone. However, conceptual\nfeasibility does not necessary entail practical feasibility.\n3.5. Income, consumption and wealth come together\n55.\nIncome flows are an important gauge for the standard of living but in the end, it is\nconsumption and consumption possibilities over time that matter. The time dimension brings\nin wealth. A low income household with above-average wealth is better off than a low-\nincome household without wealth. The existence of wealth is also one reason why income and\nconsumption are not necessarily equal: for a given income, consumption can be raised by\nrunning down assets or by increasing debts and consumption can be reduced by saving and\nadding to assets. For this reason, wealth is an important indicator of the sustainability of\nactual consumption. \n56.\nFor firms as well as for an entire country, the information about wealth is brought\ntogether in balance sheets. To construct the balance sheet of an economy, we need\ncomprehensive accounts of its assets (physical capital - and perhaps even human, natural and\nsocial capital) and its liabilities (what is owed to other countries.) To know what is happening\nto a country as a whole, we need to ascertain changes in total wealth – economic, social, and\nenvironmental. In some instances, it may be easier to account for changes in wealth than to\nestimate the level of wealth. The importance of measuring wealth, in all its main dimensions,\nis also a core recommendation of recent work on the measurement of sustainability by the\nUN-ECE, the OECD and Eurostat (2009). \n 57.\nAlthough information about many aspects of economic wealth is in principle available\nfrom national accounts' balance sheets, it is often incomplete. For some assets, price indices\nare incomplete or do not follow an agreed methodology. This concerns, for instance, the\n\n106\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nsingle most important type of asset for private households, dwellings19. Furthermore, certain\nassets are not recognized as such in the standard accounting framework. A particular\nimportant one is human capital. Those studies that computed human capital stocks found that\nthey account for an overwhelming part (80% and more) of all wealth20. A systematic\nmeasurement of human capital stocks is, however, of interest from a number of perspectives.\nIt constitutes an integral part of an extended measure of household production (see below),\nand it is a central input for the construction of sustainability indicators.\n58.\nChanges in wealth entail gross investments (in physical and human capital) minus\ndepreciation and depletion (of physical, human, and natural capital). Wealth also changes\nthrough revaluation: in the present economic crisis, plummeting house prices negatively\naffect many households, and revaluations of pension funds’ assets directly influence\nconsumption possibilities of pensioners. There is thus a direct link between stocks and flows\nand information on both is needed to assess peoples’ living standards.  \n Box 5. National accounting treatment of bank activities\nBanks and insurance companies constitute the bulk of what the national accounts call the financial\ncorporations sector. Banks main activity is considered financial intermediation, i.e., “to channel funds\nfrom lenders to borrowers by intermediating between them. They collect funds from lenders and\ntransform, or repackage, them in ways which suit the requirements of borrowers\" (1993 SNA, § 4.78).\nSome financial intermediaries raise most of their funds by taking deposits, others do so by issuing bills,\nbonds or other securities. Conversely, they lend funds by making loans or advances, or by purchasing bills,\nbonds or other securities. They bear the risk of raising and lending funds at different horizons.\nFinancial intermediaries also supply means of payment and provide services such as currency\nexchange or advice about investments or taxation. Along with FISIM (see above), these activities are part\nof their production but their value is based on explicitly charges on customers. In the French national\naccounts, about one third of banks' production is imputed and the other two thirds are directly measured.\nFinancial corporations account for about 5% of total value-added in France and in Germany and for\nabout 8% in the United States. This share is much higher in countries specialized in banking services such\nas Luxemburg (about 27%). Over the past decade, this share has remained quite stable in many OECD\ncountries. This may seem odd given the large profits (as measured in business accounts) that financial\ninstitutions have reported in the years before the present financial crisis. It must not be forgotten however,\nthat capital gains and losses are not part of the value-added generated by banks. This is a big difference\nbetween SNA and business accounting. For example, a well-known financial indicator for banks, net\nbanking income, includes property income and capital gains and losses induced by own-account financial\ntransactions. \nNor, for that matter, are interest flows (above and beyond FISIM) considered part of the value added\ngenerated by banks. Thus, the treatment of property income (interest and dividends) and capital gains or\nlosses is one of the reasons why the share of financial intermediaries remained stable in countries such as\nFrance, Germany, the United States and Luxemburg between 1999 and 2007 although banks made record\nprofits.\n19.\nIn 2009, work has started at the international level to develop a handbook on the measurement of dwelling\nprices but it will take some time before this effort leads to time series of dwelling prices with improved\ninternational comparability.\n20.\nSee, for example, Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n107\nWhile neither property income nor capital gains are part of banks’ value-added, a measure can be\nconstructed that resembles net banking income as understood in banks’ financial statements: net interest\nflows (received minus paid) and dividends received are added to value-added. The resulting measure\ndiffers from the ‘balance of primary incomes’ in national accounts because dividends paid are not\ndeducted.. Capital gains and losses, on the other hand, are a purely financial occurrence that affects wealth\nbut not income or production. The figure below shows income of French banks when net interests and\ndividends received are taken into consideration: these income flows have risen much more quickly than\nbanks‘value-added, i.e. their contribution to GDP.\n  \n59.\nPrice changes in assets such as residential dwellings or shares are not part of income in\na national accounts' sense 21. They are revaluations of assets, rather than revenues from\nproduction. This does not change the fact that many persons (and not least tax authorities) do\nconsider capital gains as a form of income that influences their behavior and economic well-\nbeing. This has led several authors to advocate the inclusion of capital gains and losses into\nmeasures of economic well-being (Eisner 1988).\n60.\nIn all probability, an income measure extended to include capital gains would exhibit\ngreater volatility than the present measure. Consideration of capital gains and losses would\nalso unevenly affect different income groups. For example, large capital gains or losses in\nshares would be proportionately more important for upper income groups – another field for\nresearch and numerical assessment. Here again, there are important conceptual problems. For\nexample, in some countries, assets are increasingly held in individual retirement accounts (to\nwhich individuals have only limited access until they reach a certain age). Should the increase\nin share values be attributed back to individuals? And how should defined benefit schemes be\naccounted for? There is currently no consensus on how to answer these questions. \nSource : INSEE\n21.\nThe International Expert Group on Household Income Statistics (Canberra Group 2001) produced a set of\nrecommendations for how best to measure household income in surveys, which included the recommendation to\nexclude capital gains from the income measure.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\nBillion €\nDividends received\nNet interests received\nValue-added\nValue-added + net interests + dividends received\n\n108\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n61.\nThe volatility of asset prices, apart from being a reason against including them in\nincome measures, raises a more fundamental problem: we use prices to “add” apples and\noranges because we believe that they represent a good measure of marginal valuations (the\nterms at which individuals are willing to trade off one good against another). But the\ninstability of asset prices is suggestive of market failures. Did the true scarcity value of oil\nsuddenly change from $147 a barrel to $36 a barrel in three months? If prices do reflect future\nresource scarcities, then the high volatility of asset prices does reflect volatility in societal\nwell-being. But there are good reasons to believe that societal well-being is not so volatile.\n62.\nFurthermore, the prices at which (market) assets are bought and sold are used to value\nthe stock as a whole. However, there may be no markets for some assets, or no trading on\nmarkets that exist (as illustrated by recent experience for a range of financial assets): this\nraises the question on how to value assets in these cases. Even when there are market prices,\nthey only correspond to the small fraction of the stock that is really transacted and they may\nbe so volatile as to put a question mark on the interpretability of balance sheets.\n63.\nWe conclude that measures of wealth are both important and uncertain. One way\nforward may indeed be to consider households’ economic situation in terms of both income\nand assets. Another, more ambitious goal, is to consider lifetime measures, although this\nraises problems of implementation and of interpretation. Despite or because all these\ncomplications, basic information on assets and liabilities is key to assessing the economic\nhealth of all sectors and the financial risks to which they are exposed.  \n4 - Second step: the household perspective \n64.\nMuch of the public discussion about living standards focuses on indicators for the entire\neconomy, and more often than not GDP. But, in the end, it is individuals whose economic\nsituation should be assessed when talking about the standard of living. A glance at the\nevolution of the real income of households and the volume change in GDP (Figure 7: Real\nhousehold disposable income and GDP Percentage growth at annual rate, 1996-20067)\nconfirms that in general, one is not a good substitute for the other. Although in some countries\nreal disposable income by households closely tracks volume GDP growth, there are many\nexamples where this is not the case – Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Slovakia, Germany – to\nname a few.\n65.\nIn other words, the household perspective provides different and policy-relevant\ninformation in addition to GDP. Household-related figures are, however, not always easily\nfound in accounting tables. It is not obvious for non-economists to establish a link between\nthe aggregates recorded in national accounts publications and the income that he or she record\nin their tax returns. Some items may be recognisable but, more often than not, the meaning\nand the connection between different items are hard to follow and evolutions of income over\ntime tend to be at variance with people’s personal perception. A greater focus on people’s\nwell-being can be achieved by focusing on national accounts measures for private\nhouseholds.\n66.\nMeasures of real household income appear to be suitable for this purpose. Earlier on, we\ndiscussed some of the income concepts for entire economies (national income, disposable\nincome etc.). These income categories can also be computed for private households. In so\ndoing, the re-distribution of income flows between economic sectors need to be taken into\naccount. For example, some of the income of citizens is taken away in the form of taxes: this\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n109\nis money that is not at their disposal. Conversely, households receive payments from\ngovernment and this must be added to their income. Households also receive and pay property\nincome, for instance dividends paid out by corporations and mortgage interest paid to banks.\nWhen all these monetary flows are taken into account, one ends up with a measure of\nhousehold disposable income.\n67.\nIn a world of perfect, symmetric information and efficient markets, it could be argued\nthat households see through the ‘sectoral veil’ and account, for instance, for the fact that\neventually corporations are owned by households and that government expenditure now may\nlead to future taxes. But perfect information is an unrealistic assumption and more often than\nnot, households will simply look at their income and wealth in judging their economic\nsituation and their consumption possibilities.    \n68.\nWhile disposable income is a useful statistic, it suffers from an important asymmetry.\nSome of the money that government collects from citizens via taxes is used to provide public\ngoods and services, and to invest in infrastructure. While disposable income measures add\nand subtract transfer payments between sectors, no adjustment is made for the value of the\ngoods and services provided by government to households in return for the taxes they paid.\nWhen an adjustment is made for the value of goods and services received, one obtains a\nmeasure of adjusted disposable income. Similar to the adjustment of disposable income, an\nadjustment for government-provided services can be made to household consumption. This\nleads to a measure that has been labeled actual final consumption by households (Box 6). \nFigure 7: Real household disposable income and GDP\nPercentage growth at annual rate, 1996-2006\nSource: OECD Annual National Accounts.\n0.0%\n0.5%\n1.0%\n1.5%\n2.0%\n2.5%\n3.0%\n3.5%\n4.0%\n4.5%\n5.0%\nCanada\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nJapan\nUnited \nKingdom\nUnited \nStates\nFinland\nKorea\nNorway\nPoland\nSlovak \nRepublic\nReal HH income\nVolume GDP\n\n110\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n4.1. Adjusting income and consumption measures for government services provided in kind  \n69.\nThe invariance principle mentioned earlier implies that a movement of an activity from\nthe public to the private sector, or vice versa, should not change our measure of economic\nperformance, unless the switch between public and private provision affects quality of the\nservice or access to it. This is where a purely market-based measure of income meets its\nlimits, and where a measure that corrects for differences in institutional set-up may be\nwarranted for comparisons over time or across countries. Adjusted household disposable\nincome and actual final consumption are measures that go some way towards accommodating\nthe invariance principle, at least where ‘social transfers in kind’ by government are\nconcerned. These measures are computed by adding to household income and to household\nconsumption expenditure the equivalent of the goods and services provided in kind by the\ngovernment (Box 6). \n70.\nThe meaning of adjusted disposable income is best explained by way of an\nexampleTable 2: Private and public insurance schemes (2). Assume that a society’s labour\nincome equals 100 and that individuals who are active in the labour market buy private health\ninsurance. They make an annual payment for the insurance equal to 10, which can be\ndecomposed into 8 units of insurance premiums (an actuarial value of a loss of 8) and 2 units\nof consumption of insurance services. At the same time, persons who are sick receive 8 units\nas reimbursement of their health expenditures. In this case – let us call it Case A – no taxes\nare paid and insurance claims and premiums offset each other, so that household disposable\nincome equals 100. Now, assume that the government decides to provide the same amount of\nhealth insurance coverage to everyone, funded through a tax of 10 units. Nothing has\nchanged, other than that the government is now collecting the insurance payment and\ndistributing the benefits (Case B). But according to standard national accounts statistics,\ndisposable income has fallen, to 90 currency units. Thus, disposable income here yields a\ndistorted comparison. If one adds in the social transfers in kind that households receive from\nthe government under Case B (8 units corresponding to the reimbursement of health\nexpenditures and 2 units corresponding to the running costs of the insurance), the adjusted\nmeasure of household disposable income indicates equality between the two cases. \n 71.\nThe above example leaves aside any consideration about which insurance regime\noperates more cost effectively and about the effects of the profits made by private insurance\ncompanies– it was simply assumed that private and public insurance services are equivalent\nto 2 currency units. In practice, insurance costs between the two schemes are likely to differ,\nalthough it is difficult to establish a general pattern. If the insurance services industry is not\nperfectly competitive (a reasonable assumption in most countries), the transfer of\nresponsibility from the private to the public sector will be reflected in decreased profits and\ndecreased insurance prices. Even if this has no consequence on household disposable income\nif profits are distributed to them in the form of dividends, it can make a difference on the\naccessibility of the insurance service. It is well known that the possibility to insure against\ncertain types of risks has a positive impact on the well-being of people who are risk adverse.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n111\nTable 2: Private and public insurance schemes\n72.\nWhile the failure to estimate the value of security services provided under the two\nschemes causes one set of biases, other biases may arise from the fact that the value of most\nsocial transfers in kind (those corresponding to the running costs of the insurance in the\nexample above) is measured by the costs of producing these services. In some countries, in\nparticular in the developing world, the cost of these services may greatly exceed their value to\nmost households, who may receive little or nothing in return. The result is a large\noverestimation of the level of adjusted household income and consumption. Some of this\noverestimation can be tackled by using output-based volume measures for health and\neducation services produced by government. It is also likely that different parts of the\npopulation benefit differently from social transfers in kind provided by government, which\nintroduces an important distributional aspect.\n73.\nIt should also be noted that the neutrality of adjusted disposable income with regard to\nthe public or private ownership of the service provider does not apply for collective services\n(e.g., security, environmental expenditures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions). When there\nis a switch from private to public provision of the service, conventional accounting lowers\nhouseholds' disposable income by the amount of tax payments although they may be better\noff. This may distort comparisons either over time or across countries.\n74.\nMajor items in social transfers in kind are health and education services, subsidized\nhousing, sport and recreation facilities that are provided to citizens at a low price or for free.\nIn France, general government provides nearly all of these services at a cost of about € 290\nbillion in 2007. As can be seen from74. Major items in social transfers in kind are health and\neducation services, subsidized housing, sport and recreation facilities that are provided to\ncitizens at a low price or for free. In France, general government provides nearly all of these\nservices at a cost of about € 290 billion in 2007. As can be seen from 8, education and health\nservices account for about one third of total transfers in kind, and housing and recreational\nand cultural activities (museums, public parks…) account for about 10%.

Despite the fact that the System of National Accounts also foresees\nmeasurement of adjusted household disposable income, there are gaps in its availability. For\nexample, neither the United States, nor Canada or the United Kingdom regularly release such\ndata. We conclude that giving more prominence to income measures of households, especially\nindicators of adjusted disposable income and actual individual consumption, are simple and\nuseful ways to enhance the relevance of national accounts statistics to the measurement of\nmaterial living standards. \n \n Box 6. Two concepts of household consumption and disposable income in national accounts\nThe System of National Accounts draws a distinction between two concepts of household\nconsumption:\n•\nFinal consumption expenditure is simply the expenditure incurred by households on consumption\nproducts, plus some imputed expenditure items such as the imputed rents that house owners pay to\nthemselves (see above for a discussion).\n•\nActual final consumption adds to final consumption expenditure the value of social transfers in kind\nthat households receive from governments. The value of these transfers is essentially measured by the\ncosts that the government incurs to provide them to citizens. National accountants draw a further\ndistinction between ‘social benefits in kind’ and ‘transfers of individual non-market goods and\nservices’. Social benefits in kind correspond, for instance, to pharmaceutical products that are\nreimbursed by the government. This consumption is recorded in government final consumption\nexpenditure but in household actual final consumption. Transfers of individual non-market goods and\nservices correspond, for instance, to the running costs of schools and hospitals. \nFigure 8: Social transfers in kind, France 2007\nSource: INSEE.\nEducation\n30%\nHealth services\n34%\nPharmaceuticals\n9%\nSocial work\n9%\nRecreational \nfacilities and \nactivities\n6%\nReal estate\n4%\nOther\n8%\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n113\nThese two concepts of consumption have a direct correspondence in two concepts of household\nincome (disposable income and adjusted disposable income) discussed in the main text. The latter is\nderived from the former by adding the value of social transfers in kind. Savings can be computed as the\ndifference between disposable income and final consumption expenditure or as the difference between\nadjusted disposable income and actual final consumption.\n4.2. Medians, mean and the distribution of market income and consumption\nIncome\n77.\nAverage measures of household income per person are helpful but give no indication\nabout how available resources are distributed across people and households. For example,\naverage income per capita can remain unchanged while the distribution of income becomes\nless equal. To better monitor how people’s income situation evolves, it is therefore necessary\nto look at income information referring to different groups. A simple way of capturing\ndistribution aspects is to measure median income, i.e. the income such that half of all\nindividuals are above that level and half below. The median individual is, in some sense, the\n“typical” individual. When inequality rises, median and average income may depart from\neach other, and a focus on average income will not give an accurate picture of the economic\nwell-being of the ‘typical’ member of society. For example, if all the increases in societal\nincome accrue to the richest 10% in society, median income may remain unchanged, while\naverage income increases. \n78.\nIn practice, moving from average to median income is more difficult than meets the eye.\nMeasures of average income are obtained by dividing total income by the total population. To\ncompute a mean, microeconomic information is needed that provides income information for\nSocial transfers\nin kind receivable\nFinal consumption\nexpenditure\nActual\nfinal\nconsumption\nTransfers of individual\nnon-market\ngoods and services\nSocial benefits\nin kind\nDisposable income\nAdjusted\ndisposable\nincome\nSocial transfers\nin kind receivable\nSaving\nSaving\nSocial transfers\nin kind receivable\nFinal consumption\nexpenditure\nActual\nfinal\nconsumption\nTransfers of individual\nnon-market\ngoods and services\nSocial benefits\nin kind\nDisposable income\nAdjusted\ndisposable\nincome\nSocial transfers\nin kind receivable\nSaving\nSaving\n\n114\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nindividuals or households. Microeconomic measures of household income refer to people living\nin private households and are typically derived from household surveys whereas macroeconomic\nmeasures are provided by the national accounts. The two sources are not necessarily compatible\nmaking it difficult to compute a median or other distributional information from surveys that is\ncompatible with the average figure in the national accounts (Box 7).\n Box 7. Differences between macro and micro-estimates of household income\nThere are several differences in concept and in statistical practice between income measures emanating\nfrom the national accounts (‘macro-estimates’) and income measures derived from household surveys\n(‘micro-estimates’). Most important differences are:\n•\nMicro-estimates of household income exclude people living in institutions as well as non-profit\ninstitutions serving households. Conversely, both of these are covered in macro-estimates. \n•\nMicro-estimates of household income are generally limited to those income flows that are received by\nhouseholds on a regular basis, i.e. excluding those irregular flows that are instead covered in macro-\nestimates, such as bonuses. \n•\nHousehold surveys generally refer to income received in cash or quasi-cash. Macro-estimates, on the\nother hand, include income in kind and several imputed items, such as the agricultural goods produced\nfor own consumption (which are important in countries with a large subsistence-agriculture) and\nseveral types of property income. The single most important item in the national accounts is imputed\nrents from owner-occupied housing\nBeyond these differences in definitions, other factors affect the measurement of individual income\ncomponents in the two sources. For example, the national accounts include social security contributions\npaid by firms in both the “compensation of employees” received by households and in the taxes they pay,\nwhile survey measures of “gross earnings” are reported net of these contributions. \nReconciliation of micro- and macro-estimates is tedious but possible. Of particular import here is how\nimputed income flows can be distributed among income groups of households. Research in this area has\nprogressed (see Annex A) but is still sporadic. \nSome household surveys focus on consumption expenditure rather than income. In principle, many of\nthe distinctions noted above are not relevant. Still, there are large, and possibly increasing, disparities in\nmeasures of household consumption from the two sources, due to reporting biases—upper income\nindividuals may not report all of their consumption. Further problems are introduced by the fact that the\nprices paid for various goods may systematically vary across income groups.  \nConsumption, income and wealth\n79.\nIncome and its distribution are meaningful ways to assess living standards. Another\ncandidate is consumption and its distribution among individuals. While correlated with\nincome, consumption and its distribution are not necessarily identical to income and several\nreasons account for this. First, consumption tends to be driven by permanent, long-term\nincome more than by short-term changes in income. Many households compensate short-term\nincome fluctuations by increased savings or by borrowing. In this sense, income distributions\nshould be more subject to transitory shifts in persons’ income (which may reverse themselves\nafter a while) than distributions of consumption.\n80.\nSecond, differences between a household’s position in the income and in the\nconsumption distribution are often reflective of differences in the distribution of wealth. Only\nsome wealth effects are picked up by income measures, for example receipts of rents as part\nof property income. Other wealth effects such as realised capital gains are not normally\nreflected in income measures but are likely to affect consumption. Thus, consumption\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n115\npatterns are more reflective of wealth than income patterns. One could also say that both\nincome and wealth determine consumption possibilities which will then give rise to actual\nconsumption. This explains why some authors have opted for wealth-adjusted income\nmeasures to capture consumption possibilities and their distribution in the population.   \n81.\nHowever, there are empirical advantages to using income rather than consumption data\n– income information at the individual level tends to be more readily available than\nconsumption data.\nDistribution measures\n82.\nThere is a large literature on how best to reflect the distribution of resources22. One of\nthe most intuitive measures was used earlier in the present text, the difference between the\nmean and the median of a distribution. Other standard measures include the Lorenz curve\n(indicating the percentage of resources over which a certain percentage of the population has\ncommand) and the Gini coefficient (a summary measure of the area between exactly equality\nof the distribution of resources and the actual distribution, i.e., the Lorenz curve). Another\ncommon approach is dividing the population into quantile or decile groups and then following\nthe share of resources of each group over time. Some authors have advocated combined\nmeasures, for example Yitzhaki (1979) who shows that the product of the Gini coefficient and\naverage income reflects a concept of relative deprivation where people’s living standards not\nonly depend on the absolute income or consumption possibilities but also on where their\nconsumption possibility are with regard to a reference group.     \n83.\nSome measure of distribution have been used to adjust aggregate variables, for example\nSen (1976) proposed an adjustment of total income by (one minus) the Gini coefficient. Kolm\n(1969) and Atkinson (1970) developed indices that explicitly introduce distributional\nobjectives into measures of inequality by adding a parameter reflecting the degree of aversion\nthat society attaches to inequality. Jorgenson (1990) showed how information about\nconsumption expenditure and aversion towards inequality can be combined to yield a\nmeasure of living standards.     \n84.\nOther aspects of the income distribution, beyond median income, are also important.\nFor instance, social problems may be related to developments in the bottom part of the\nincome distribution, which shape the living conditions of the poor. Real incomes of different\nquintiles of the income distribution can also be followed\n85.\nIn France, INSEE is presently working on a breakdown of household disposable income\nand consumption by household type in the national accounts. First results by quintile have\nalready been published for the year 2003. Households are distinguished by household\ncomposition, income, age and  social category of the reference person in the household (see\nAccardo et al., 2009).\n86.\nTable 3: Trend in real household income* by 3 shows trends in survey-based measures\nof household disposable income deflated with a consumer price index over the past two\ndecades. Thus, no account has been taken of the fact that different income groups may\nexperience different rates of price change. Broadly, the earlier messages about France and the\n22.\nThe report of the Canberra Group (2001) provides an overview and Cowell (2000) a more extensive review\nof the various approaches.\n\n116\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nUnited States are confirmed: over the past ten years, the United States have recorded a\nmarkedly slower income growth for people in the bottom quintile relative to the other\nquintiles whereas in France income in the bottom and middle quintiles grew about at the same\nrate as average income.\n87.\nAn important choice lies with the unit of measurement. Macro-estimates give totals for\na whole country or sector, while micro data retain the household (or the family) as unit within\nwhich resources are pooled and shared, and adjust income for differences in “needs.” There\nare, for instance, fixed costs to running a household, allowing larger families with the same\nincome to have a higher standard of living.  Another step towards bringing demography and\nsome distributional aspects into income measures is to calculate disposable income per\nconsumption unit or per household rather than per person. Consumption units are households\nwith an adjustment for their size so that account is taken of economies of scale in housing and\nother costs. This adjustment is important as the size of households changes over time and\ndiffers across countries23.  With average household size declining, increases in income per\nhousehold will exceed those based on consumption units24. On the other hand, there are\ndiseconomies of scale.  The benefits of living in smaller units is, presumably, one of the\nreasons that as incomes have risen, household size has decreased. Thus, if one argues that\npeople choose to live in smaller households and voluntarily foregoing the scale economies\nfrom living in larger units, the case for measuring income per consumption unit appears less\ncompelling.  Our measure of “consumption units” does not take this extra value from living in\nsmaller units into account, and may accordingly understate increases in living standards. That\nsaid, many empirical studies have opted for the consumption unit, including a recent major\nreport in France:  Ruiz (2009) reports that real household income per consumption unit may\ndecline even when total real household income per capita goes up. The author concludes also\nthat presenting data in consumption unit brings perceived and measured real income changes\nbetter in line. \n88.\nIn many countries, there are important issues of intra-family distribution of income,\nconsumption, and more generally and well-being.  Unfortunately, data on these intra-family\ndistributions is only available episodically. We know from time use studies (described below),\nhowever, that there are large gender differences.\nSome results\n89.\nAgainst this background, we can consider the evolution of average and median\nhousehold income in several countries 89. Against this background, we can consider the\nevolution of average and median household income in several countries show results for\nFrance and for the United States. These results are illustrations much more than definite data\nand Annex C provides more information on the statistical obstacles that needed to be\novercome for this comparison. SNA measures of average household disposable income per\n23.\nFor the present purpose, the relation between the number of households and the number of consumption units\nwas postulated as CU = HH*(POP/HH)0.5. Thus, the number of consumption units CU equals the number of\nhouseholds HH, adjusted by the square root of the average household size POP/HH where POP stands for\npopulation. Note that this is only one of many possibilities to derive consumption units. \n24.\nOn the other hand, there are diseconomies of scale.  The benefits of living in smaller units is, presumably,\none of the reasons that as incomes have risen, household size has decreased.  Our measure of “consumption units”\ndoes not take this into account, and may accordingly understate increases in living standards.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n117\ncapita and per consumption unit diverge significantly in the case of France, reflecting a trend\ntowards smaller household size.

An important source of\ndiscrepancy between micro and macro estimates is property income. If this aggregate is not\nwell measured in micro estimates, and if the distribution of property income becomes more\nunequal than the distribution of other income, this could explain why average and median\nincomes in these estimates have a parallel evolution in France. Also, the international\ncomparability between household surveys is far from perfect.\n 91.\nAnother way in which national accounts and household data may be brought closer\ntogether is by looking more closely at the share of wages in total income. For example,\nAtkinson and Voitchovsky (2008) examine trends in the share in total Net Domestic Income\nof the wages earned by all workers, by the bottom 90 per cent and by the bottom 50 per cent\nFigure 9: Trends in different measures of household disposable income\nSource: Computations based on OECD SNA and income distribution data (see Annex C).\nFrance\n0.90\n1.00\n1.10\n1.20\n1.30\n1.40\n1.50\n1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nAverage per capita income, SNA\nAverage per consumption unit, SNA\nAverage per consumption unit, survey\nMedian per consumption unit, survey\n \nUnited States\n0.90\n1.00\n1.10\n1.20\n1.30\n1.40\n1.50\n1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nAverage per capita incom e, SNA\nAverage per consum ption unit, SNA\nAverage per consum ption unit, survey\nM edian per consum ption unit, survey\n\n118\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nof workers based on data for the United Kingdom from the Annual Survey of Hours and\nEarnings/New Earnings Survey data. The evolution of this wage share is certainly different\nwhen one considers the bottom half of the distribution. In the 1950s, when the overall wage\nshare was rising slightly, the bottom half suffered a reduction in their share. Between 1954\nand 1964, the wage share rose by 1½ percentage points, but the share of the bottom half of\nworkers fell by 2 percentage points. In 2006, the overall wage share is virtually the same as it\nwas in 1954, but the share of the bottom 50 per cent was 4 percentage points lower. Of this\nfall, approximately a third can be attributed to the decline in the wage share and two-thirds to\nincreased wage dispersion. \n92.\nFrom a perspective of living standards, the distribution of income and wealth\ndetermines who enjoys access to the consumption of goods and services produced within a\nsociety. One of the reasons why average per capita measures of income, consumption and\nwealth often fail to reflect peoples’ perceptions of how their resources and consumption\npossibilities change over time is that the benefits of growth are not equally distributed – some\npeople in society can be worse off even if average incomes have increased.

Ideally, such distributional measures should be conceptually compatible with\naverage measures from the national accounts.    \n4.3. Price indices  – temporal comparison\n93.\nTo convert nominal measures of income and consumption into real measures, price\nindices are required. For comparisons of living standards, price indices of bundles of\nconsumer goods and services are the appropriate choice. It is useful to dwell on the nature of\nthe price index to be employed for the measurement of real income and to briefly discuss the\nnotion of cost-of-living indices.\n94.\nRecently, the Panel on Conceptual, Measurement, and other Statistical Issues in\nDeveloping Cost-of-Living Indexes (Schultze and Mackie eds., 2002) presented a series of\nrecommendations for the development of the US Consumer Price Index. Many points raised\nin this report are directly relevant for the questions at hand. In particular, the report refers to\nthe concept of cost-of-living indices and to the distinction between conditional and\nunconditional indices. A cost-of-living index aims at measuring the relative change in\nexpenditure that a household would have to make in order to maintain a given standard of\nliving25. Every cost-of-living index has to be defined with respect to a particular domain, or\nscope (i.e. the goods and services included in the index), keeping other factors fixed. Thus,\nchanges in the standard of living are measured with conditions outside the scope of the index\nheld constant. What exactly should be within the scope of the index, and on which factors the\nindex should be conditioned, depends on the analytical question at hand. The Panel, for\nexample, recommended that for purposes of constructing the U.S. Consumer Price Index,\nonly private (market) goods and services should be inside the scope of the index, i.e. changes\nin non-market commodities (leisure), environmental conditions (climate) and other societal\nfactors (crime) should not influence the evolution of the index. \n95.\nFor other analytical purposes, however, the scope of cost-of-living indexes could be\ndifferent and this is the case for the measures discussed in the present document. More\nspecifically, for the purpose of comparing living standards, the domain of a cost-of-living\nindex could be made commensurate with a broader notion of income, encompassing at a\nminimum, government-provided services such as health and education. A further extension\n(see below) would be to include non-market services that households produce themselves\nand, possibly, leisure. Accounting for goods and services provided for free or at subsidized\nprices by government is not without problems, however. The inclusion of such services\nintroduces uncertainty about data quality as, by definition, there are no prices for non-market\nproducts. At the same time, non-market goods and services are important elements for the\nliving conditions of citizens and their provision potentially affects international comparisons\nof living standards26.\n25.\nOne particular feature of a cost-of-living index is that it takes into account the effects of substitution by\nconsumers when the relative prices of goods and services change. This is mainly achieved by the choice of\nsuperlative index number formulae (Diewert 1976). Diewert (2001) and Triplett (2001) provide in-depth\ndiscussions of the consumer price index as a cost-of-living index.\n\n120\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n96.\nTable 4: Price changes and real income of households and total economy 1995-20064\nprovides estimates of real income trends based of alternative choices for the relevant\ndeflators. Several patterns stand out.  \n• First, the nominal change in disposable household income is close that for adjusted\ndisposable income for France and the United States, but less so for Finland. . Similarly,\nthe price indices of final consumption expenditure and actual final consumption are\nquite similar in France and in the United States but not so in Finland. Whether higher\ninflation in government-provided services than in market-provided services in Finland\nreflects economic reality or the statistical method employed to measure price (or unit\ncost) non-market services remains an open issue. But the results show that moving from\none price index to another is not a trivial matter, and that getting price and volume\nmeasures for publicly-provided services right makes a difference for the assessment of\nhouseholds’ living standards. More detail on this issue in conjunction with government\nprovided health and education services is provided below.\n• Second, (and confirming the result already highlighted in  Figure 7: Real household\ndisposable income and GDP Percentage growth at annual rate, 1996-20067) differences\nin the growth rates of household real income and economy-wide real income can be\nsignificant, as shown by the Finnish case (where real household income has grown by\nmore than one percentage point less per year over the past decade than economy-wide\n26.\nThe cost-of-living index proposed here would have the following components: (i) prices of goods and\nservices of private final consumption, i.e. market prices directly available from national accounts; and (ii) prices of\nindividual services provided by government (such as health and education). For this second group of items, the\nlack of market prices implies that unit costs should enter the cost-of-living index. Whether these unit costs should\nrefer to the costs per unit of output or the costs per unit of input is an important question and country practice\nvaries on this point. When income or consumption measures are further extended to include the services that\nhouseholds produce for themselves, the scope of the cost-of-living index should be equally extended to cover the\nunit costs of producing these services. \nTable 4: Price changes and real income of households and total economy 1995-2006\nPercentage change at annual rate\n \nFrance\nUnited \nStates\nFinland\nDisposable incom e* (current prices)\n3.7%\n5.2%\n4.4%\nPrice index final consum ption expenditure\n1.3%\n2.0%\n1.6%\nReal disposable incom e\n2.4%\n3.1%\n2.8%\nAdjusted disposable incom e* (current prices)\n3.8%\n5.2%\n4.5%\nPrice index actual final consum ption\n1.6%\n2.2%\n2.0%\nReal adjusted disposable incom e*\n2.2%\n3.1%\n2.5%\nNational disposable incom e (current prices)\n3.6%\n5.6%\n5.7%\nPrice index dom estic dem and\n1.6%\n2.1%\n1.9%\nReal national disposable incom e**\n2.1%\n3.5%\n3.8%\n*For private households and non-profit institutions serving households; net of depreciation.\n**Note that deflation with a dom estic dem and deflator is but one possibility to obtain real incom e.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n121\nreal income). The gap is smaller for the United States and absent in France but likely to\nbe present in many other countries.\n97.\nWhile the concepts and problems that are involved in constructing good price indices\nare well understood27, the rapid changes in relative prices, economic structures, and product\ndesign and characteristics have meant that conventional methods towards measuring price\nchange may be inadequate in capturing these changes. For instance, in 1996 the US Advisory\nCommittee to Study the Consumer Price Index (widely known as the Boskin Commission\nafter its chair, Michael Boskin) concluded that the CPI overstated the cost of living by about\n1.1 percentage points per year, implying that real growth was understated by the same\namount. The report called attention to problems associated with adjustments for quality\nchanges, to the appearance of new products (particularly relevant in fast changing sectors like\nhealth and IT, but also in retailing), and to problems in data collection of data (e.g. the\nincreasing fraction of sales done over the internet, and at discount stores).  Quality change is\nalso an important topic in the report by the Panel on Conceptual, Measurement, and other\nStatistical Issues in Developing Cost-of-Living Indexes (Schultze and Mackie eds., 2002).\nDiewert (1998) estimates that for a measured price change of about 2% per year, the quality\nbias may be as large as 0.4 percentage points in the US CPI. Deaton (1998), on the other hand,\nquestions the practical feasibility as well as some of the conceptual foundations for the need\nto capture quality change and to target a cost-of-living index. The reader is referred to the\nextensive literature on price indices that brings out the many conceptual and empirical issues\ninvolved in capturing quality change. It is evident that there is no simple or unique\nmethodology. \n98.\nA point of particular relevance from a welfare perspective is the question about ‘whose’\nprice index is evaluated. Often, conceptual discussions about price indices are conducted as if\nthere were a single representative consumer. Statistical agencies calculate the increase in\nprices by looking at the costs of an average bundle of goods. However, different people buy\ndifferent bundles of goods (e.g. poor people spend more on food and less on entertainment)\nand they may buy their goods and services in different types of stores (which sell “similar”\nproducts at very different prices). When all prices move together, having different indices for\ndifferent people may not make much a difference. But recently, with soaring oil and food\nprices, these differences may have become more marked and people at the bottom of the\nincome distribution may have seen real incomes fall by much more than those at the top of the\nincome distribution.\n99.\nDeaton (1998) relates the income-specific price indices back to the problem of quality\nmeasurement. He argues that quality effects are income related and that the “benefits of\nquality upgrading and of new goods will only be distributionally neutral if the affected goods\nare neither luxuries nor necessities. While it is true that advances in the technology of\nconsumption have benefitted people in all parts of the income distribution, it is hard to believe\nthat many of the relevant goods are not luxuries. When new goods are consumed\ndisproportionately by the rich, whose price indexes are weighted in the CPI according to their\nincomes, the quality-corrected plutocratic index can provide a very poor measure of prices for\nthe average consumer.” \n27.\nFor an overview of price index theory and price measurement see Diewert (1987), IMF et al. (2004) and ILO\net al. (2004).\n\n122\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n100. A price index for (actual) private consumption28 of major groups in society (by age,\nincome, or place of residence such as rural vs. urban population) is necessary if we are to\nappraise their economic situation. One of the recommendations of the Commission mésures\ndu pouvoir d’achat des ménages (2008) (Commission on the measurement of purchasing\npower of households) in France was to develop consumer price indices for owners of\ndwellings, for renters and for households that are about to purchase dwellings (Ruiz 2009).\nOther relevant categories potentially exist. However, such prices indices are not available in\nmost countries. While indices with different weights for different groups of the population are\neasily computed and exist in several countries (such as the United Kingdom, France,\nGermany), they tend to show relatively similar movements. A full development of price\nindices differentiated by socio-economic groups would require, however, the collection of\ndifferent prices for different parts of the population, so that socio-economic aspects are taken\ninto account in data collection design. This is likely to be difficult and costly. This\ndevelopment should constitute a medium-term objective – a recommendation that echoes a\nsimilar conclusion by Schultze and Mackie (2002)29. Such work would not only foster the\nquality of deflation procedures, but also make it easier for citizens to assess their personal\nsituation through some of the income and price data released by statistical offices.      \n4.4. Price indices – spatial comparison\n101. Just as there are price indices to deflate nominal income or consumption over time\nwithin a country, price indices are also required to deflate nominal income or consumption for\ncomparisons in space, i.e. across countries or regions. Spatial price indices, or Purchasing\nPower Parities (PPP), have a long tradition in the OECD area30; recently, new world-wide\nPPPs have been released by the World Bank. Many of the issues outlined above for temporal\nprice indices are shared by PPPs. For example, comparing different qualities of the same type\nof product across countries is inherently difficult. The equivalent of the problem of new goods\nin temporal price indices is the problem of goods existing in one country but not in another. In\nmany respects, measurement issues are even more pronounced with PPPs than with temporal\nprice indices.\n102. For the purpose at hand – international comparisons of real income and consumption -\nPPPs need to be chosen to best reflect the different goods and services that are of interest for\nour comparison. A meaningful spatial deflator for disposable income (and of course for final\nconsumption expenditure) is the PPP for final consumption expenditure, while a meaningful\nspatial deflator for adjusted disposable income is the PPP for actual individual consumption.\nWe use 2005 benchmark PPPs for the comparison at hand. \n28.\nFor a discussion of cost-of-living indices in conjunction with the production of household services see Hill\n(2009).\n29.\nThe Schultze commission states: “BLS [the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics] should pursue an\nexploratory research program that would, initially only on a small scale, investigate and assess several alternative\napproaches – including, but not limited to, the use by survey respondents of handheld scanners and computers – for\ncollecting prices in a way that allows them to be associated with household characteristics. A first objective might\nbe the production of indexes for a few commodity categories and several demographic groups.” Schultze and\nMackie (eds.) (2002), p. 5.\n30.\nSee, for example, the OECD website under http://www.oecd.org/topicstatsportal/0,3398,en_2825_\n495691_1_1_1_1_1,00.html \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n123\n103. Table 5: Real income of households, comparisons across countries, 20055 shows that in\n2005 French per capita disposable household income was at 66% of the U.S. level, and\nFinnish per capita disposable income at 49% of the U.S. level31. When government-provided\ngoods and services are taken into account, this gap is significantly reduced: real adjusted\ndisposable income per capita in France is 79% of the U.S. level and Finland’s at 68%. This, of\ncourse, reflects the fact that the two European countries have a larger share of social transfers\nin kind (which raise final comparison) than the United States. Finally, all household-related\ncomparisons paint a picture that is quite distinct from one based on GDP per capita. We\nshould add that even this real income comparison for households is incomplete from the\nperspective of living standards, as important non-market activities by households and leisure\nare neglected. \n4.5. Risk and vulnerability\n104. Considering wealth brings to the fore considerations about risk, exposure to risk and\nvulnerability. For example, when pension systems increasingly rely on private providers and\nwhen households invest in riskier financial assets than hitherto, this creates greater exposure\nof households’ financial resources to volatility in financial markets. The simple indicator of\nriskiness of household financial assets for France (i.e. the share of households wealth held in\nassets with a high exposure to investment risks) shows a clear growing exposure of French\nhouseholds towards more risky assets. It should be noted that the figure reflects both direct\nand indirect exposure of French households, i.e. the exposure of portfolios of institutional\ninvestors who offer mutual fund shares and life insurance policies to households is also\naccounted for in the indicator (we refer to this adjustment as the “transparency” adjustment) \n105.  The riskiness indicator shown above concerns all French households. As with measures\nof income, it would be helpful to break this measure down by socio-economic group, thereby\ntracking which part of the population is most exposed to financial volatility.     \n106. On an annual basis, we could think of individuals as self-insuring, putting aside, say a\n3% reserve for the expected annual loss from fire. Similarly, we could think of individuals\n31.\nIncome levels in France and Finland relative to the United States are higher than relative consumption levels\nbecause of higher savings rates in the two European countries.\nTable 5: Real income of households, comparisons across countries, 2005\nSource: OECD Annual National Accounts.\nFrance\nUnited States\nFinland\nUSD\n19338\n29448\n14395\nUSA=100\n66\n100\n49\nUSD\n25378\n32110\n21771\nUSA=100\n79\n100\n68\nReal GDP per capita (total economy)\nUSD\n30519\n41740\n30460\nUSA=100\n73\n100\n73\n*For private households and non-profit institutions serving households; net of depreciation; converted with PPPs for final consumption expenditure\n**Equals disposable income corrected for social transfers in kind and converted with PPPs for actual individual consumption\nReal disposable income* per capita*\nReal adjusted disposable income** per capita\n\n124\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nsetting aside a reserve against a portfolio loss. If individuals undertake greater risk, they\nshould set aside greater reserves. In reality, individuals don’t do that. If the income generated\nby undertaking greater risk is included in conventional income measures (for instance through\nperformance-related bonuses for financial investors), while capital losses are not, this leads to\nan asymmetry that may bias long term measures. At the national level, the accounting\nconsequences of greater exposure to risks become important in making inferences about the\neffect of different policies. Using metrics that do not reflect future expected losses may, for\ninstance, give an excessively optimistic view of the effects of deregulations of the financial\nsector. As a general point, the current national accounting system is ill-equipped to reflect\nfinancial risk and this may lead to biased pictures of corporations’ and households’ exposure\nto risk. .\n4.6. Broader measures of households’ economic activity\n107. Production and income measures in the national accounts include all non-market goods\nproduced by households32, as well as one important service item, i.e. the value of rents that\nowners of dwellings ‘pay to themselves’33. However, no other services that households\nproduce for themselves34 are measured in the standard accounts. This can generate biases on\nseveral fronts, one of which is to exaggerate the growth rates of developing countries (Deaton\n2005) where this type of production is relatively important. \n108. Service activities that households undertake for themselves include cleaning, cooking,\nchildcare, driving to work and so on. In principle, the time spent on these productive activities\ncan be measured, valued and integrated with the traditional national accounts and income\nFigure 10: Share of risky assets in households' financial wealth, France\nSource: Marionnet (2007).\n32.\nNot only households undertake non-market production. Government is another big non-market producer but,\nunlike households, the services that it provides are recognised in the standard national accounts.\n33.\nIn France, imputed rents account for about14% of final consumption expenditure. In the United States, the\nshare is about 11%.\n34.\nNor is production and use of services recorded that households produce for free for others such as free\nsoftware.\n10% \n15% \n20% \n25% \n30% \n35% \n40% \nDec- \n94 \nDec- \n95 \nDec- \n96 \nDec- \n97 \nDec- \n98 \nDec- \n99 \nDec- \n00 \nDec- \n01 \nDec- \n02 \nDec- \n03 \nDec- \n04 \nDec- \n05 \nAfter transparency \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n125\nmeasures. Past studies35 have shown that these household services are important and that\ntheir consideration is likely to change the level, distribution and growth of expanded measures\nof household income, consumption (and investment). As such services can substitute goods\nand services purchased in the market, even if they are not directly marketable, they can affect\nhow individuals dispose of marketed income.\n109. There have been large changes in the functioning of households and the society. For\nexample, many of the services that people received from their family in the past are now\npurchased on the market. This shift translates into a rise of income, as measured in the\nnational account, and this may give a false impression of a change in living standards, while it\nonly reflects a shift from non-market to market provision of services36. A shift from private to\npublic provision of a particular product should not affect measured output. By the same token,\na shift of production from market to household production or vice versa, should not affect\nmeasured output. In practice, this invariance principle is not assured by current conventions\non the measurement of household services.  \n110. Imagine a two-parent household with two children with an income of $50,000 a year, in\nwhich only one parent works full-time for pay and the other specializes in home production.\nThe parent who stays at home does all shopping, cooks all meals, does all cleaning and child\ncare. As a result, this household does not need to devote any of its market income to such\npurchases. Now, imagine a two-parent household with two children in which both parents\nwork full-time for the same overall pay ($50,000 a year), and neither parent has any time left\nover for household production or child care. They must pay for shopping, cooking, cleaning\nand child care out of pocket. Their available income is reduced. Standard measures of family\nliving standards treat these households as if they have identical living standards but obviously\nthey don’t. \n111. A more complete picture of household production could be drawn by constructing a full\nset of accounts for households. Such an endeavor would not only consider the household\nservices mentioned above but also include education, as an investment that increases the\nmagnitude of human capital. Comprehensive accounting of this investment would, of course,\nhave to take account of the depreciation of human capital, e.g. as a result of aging. Studies in\nthe United States (Jorgenson and Fraumeni 1989, 1992) that used such a comprehensive\nmeasure of productive activity found that the resulting numbers were large: for example,\ninvestment in human capital turned out to be at least four times investment in non-human\ncapital.\n112. Finally, recognizing household production may alter our assessment of the pace of\neconomic growth and of the distribution of income and consumption. A recent major report\n35.\nFor example, Rüger and Varjonen (2008); Landefeld and McCulla (2000), Landefeld, Fraumeni and Vojtech\n(2006).\n36.\nSee Folbre and Wagman (1993) and well as  Wagman and Folbre (1996). Note that there may be extra social\nvalue in the fact that production takes place via market transactions rather than within households due to the simple\nfact that jobs are created and that jobs tend to constitute more than just sources of earnings to individual. In this\nsense, a shift between market and non-market production may not be neutral. Of course, the same point can be\nmade with inverted signs – some household production activities may generate utility above and beyond the\nmarket equivalent value. Raising children comes to mind as an example. \n\n126\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\non non-market activities and their measurement (Abraham and Mackie, eds., 2005) sums this\nconsideration up as follows:\n“The key point in this discussion is that economic growth can alter the relative\nimportance of home and market production. That in turn may lead to incorrect\ninferences about how fast average economic well-being is growing if only market GDP\nis measured. Since changes in the scope of home production will differ across income\ngroups as their opportunities change, ignoring it in measuring incomes also will bias\nconclusions about how inequality is changing.“ (Abraham and Mackie, p. 62).\n113. In what follows, we present some illustrative calculations of the implications of\ncomplementing conventionally-measured household income by non-market production of\nhousehold services, i.e. moving towards a notion of “full income” (Becker 1965) and full\nconsumption. \n4.7. Time use\n114. Table 6 provides a first comparison of time spent per household and day on various\nactivities. Household production comprises time spent on housework, purchasing goods and\nservices, caring for and helping household and non-household members, volunteer activities,\ntelephone calls, mails and emails and travel time related to all these activities. ‘Personal care’\nis mainly sleeping, eating and drinking, whereas ‘paid work’ includes the time spend in paid\nwork or study either at home or in the workplace, and the commuting time related to it.\n‘Leisure’ was defined residually, and it includes sports, religious and spiritual activities and\nother leisure activities. The time spent on personal care activities in various countries has\nbeen normalized across countries to the lowest value because, to minimise the effect of\ninternational differences in survey designs on results37. At the same time, normalisation bears\nthe risk of ironing over true differences in behaviour between countries.\n115. Another ambiguity in the data presented relates to travelling. It constitutes a case of\ntime use whose allocation to production or consumption is not straightforward. Adding up\ntravelling and housework attenuates differences between some European countries and the\nUnited States in time spent on non-market production. The categorization we use follows the\nconvention in the time-use literature and allocates time spent travelling to the activity that it is\nassociated with. That is, travel time related to paid employment is added to paid work and\ntravel time for child care and housework is added to time for non-market work. There is also\nsome arbitrariness to the definition of what makes up leisure. In particular, eating and\ndrinking are included in personal care whereas, arguably, part of eating and drinking is time\nspent on leisure. Many view cooking — and then eating — a good meal as a most enjoyable\nleisure activity, not a chore that is easily substitutable with a meal in a fast food restaurant.  \n116. With the normalised data and the above caveats (for more detailed information, see\nAnnex A), one finds that more time is spent on household production in European countries\nas opposed to the United States. The United States is also one of the few countries where\nmore time is spent on paid work than on housework (Freeman and Schettkat, 2005). The\npicture concerning leisure is similar. More time is spent on leisure in Finland, France, Italy,\nGermany and the United Kingdom than in the United States (6). Note that these differences\n37.\nMore discussion of methods and limitations to international comparability of time use surveys are provided\nin OECD (2009). \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n127\nwould increase further if eating time were allocated differently. According to the time use\nsurveys at hand, Americans spend on average 74 minutes per day on eating and drinking\nwhereas the same activity takes up 135 minutes on average in France. 7 shows an alternative\nallocation of eating and drinking time – half of which has been allocated to leisure instead of\npersonal care. Also, no normalisation has been made for the personal care time. Leisure time\nin France now turns out to be lower than in the United States. The time spent on unpaid\nhousehold work now is nearly identical between the two countries. We conclude that the\nallocation of specific activities to time use categories as well as their international comparison\nleaves room for improvement and harmonisation.   \nTable 6: Time use of population (age 16 and older) \nMinutes per day, normalized for personal care activities; latest years available*\n*Unites States: 2005, Finland 1998, France 1998, Germany 2002, Italy 2003, United Kingdom 2001.\nSource: OECD (2009), based on HETUS and ATUS databases.\nTable 7: Time use of population (age 16 and older)\nMinutes per day, 50% of time for eating and drinking allocated to leisure; latest years available*\n*Unites States: 2005, Finland 1998, France 1998, Germany 2002, Italy 2003, United Kingdom 2001.\nSource: OECD (2009), based on HETUS and ATUS databases.\nFigure 11: Housework, paid work and leisure\nMinutes per day and person, latest year available*\n*using normalised series for personal care; Unites States: 2005, Finland 1998, France 1999, Germany 2002,\nItaly 2003, United Kingdom 2001.\nSource: OECD (2009), based on HETUS and ATUS databases.\nPersonal care\nUnspecified time use\nTotal\nTotal\nMen\nWomen\nTotal\nMen\nWomen\nTotal\nMen\nWomen\nGermany \n616\n196\n251\n144\n219\n161\n273\n394\n371\n349\n15\n1440\nItaly \n616\n219\n300\n143\n232\n107\n352\n360\n343\n264\n13\n1440\nUK\n616\n229\n289\n171\n228\n160\n291\n356\n355\n322\n11\n1440\nFrance\n616\n215\n269\n167\n215\n147\n276\n358\n283\n249\n36\n1440\nFinland\n616\n222\n261\n185\n209\n159\n251\n376\n376\n348\n17\n1440\nUSA\n616\n245\n291\n203\n213\n161\n261\n344\n332\n294\n22\n1440\nPaid work\nUnpaid work \nLeisure \nPersonal \ncare\nPaid work\nEducation\nUnpaid \nwork \nLeisure \nUnspecified \ntime use\nTotal time\nGermany \n598\n183\n13\n219\n413\n15\n1440\nItaly \n360\n207\n12\n232\n616\n13\n1440\nUK\n592\n220\n9\n228\n381\n11\n1440\nFrance\n642\n201\n14\n215\n333\n36\n1440\nFinland\n591\n207\n15\n209\n402\n17\n1440\nUSA\n611\n227\n18\n213\n349\n22\n1440\n\n128\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n117. Gender differences in time use are significant. In each of the countries under\nconsideration, men spend more time in paid work than women and the converse is true for\nunpaid work. Men also spend more time on leisure than women. The implication is that\nwomen provide household services but other members of the household benefit. This\ndistributional issue within households gets lost when income or consumption per household\nare considered.   \nTable 8: Time spent in different activities, ratio men/women\n*Unites States: 2005, Finland 1998, France 1999, Germany 2002, Italy 2003, United Kingdom 2001.\nSource: OECD (2009), based on HETUS and ATUS databases.\n118. A major gap in time use data is availability of consistent time series. Time use surveys\nhave been conducted in the past but, in most cases, not periodically, and comparability\nbetween surveys is often limited. The assessment of time use over longer periods has to take\nrecourse to approximations and estimates of varying quality. This also holds for the present\nstudy. An important statistical task for the future will be to build up internationally\ncomparable time series of information on how people use time to allow assessing trends. Such\nwork is under way in the United States and in several European countries but lacking in many\nother parts of the world.\n4.8. Valuing the production of household services\n119. It is possible to provide an illustrative calculation for the value of household production\nfor France, Finland and for the United States. The approach chosen here is simple38: the value\nof household services is measured by their costs39. Two basic cost items are considered, the\nvalue of labor inputs and the value of capital services from consumer durables. In what\nfollows, we will also assume that the volume of household production varies with the volume\nof the labor and capital inputs. This assumption implies that there is no productivity change in\nthe production of household services. Many of the points that were made earlier in\nconjunction with measuring the value of government services apply here as well, i.e. our\nmethod to quantify values and volumes of household production is input-based.\n  \n38.\nFor more elaborate and focused studies, for example on childcare, see Folbre and Jayoung (2008).\n39.\nSchreyer and Diewert (2009) show that this choice implies either that households are constrained in their\npossibility to deliver additional hours to the labour market or that households choose to engage in own-account\nproduction because the net benefit from spending time on household work is positive. Alternatively, household\nproduction could be given a market valuation if an equivalent product is offered on the market. This complicates\nmatters, however, and has not been pursued here. For a recent discussion with indications of the quantitative\nimpact of this methodological choice, see Fraumeni (2008).  \nPaid work\nUnpaid work\nLeisure\nGermany \n1.74\n0.66\n1.36\nItaly \n2.10\n0.62\n2.17\nUK\n1.69\n0.75\n1.43\nFrance\n1.61\n0.78\n1.46\nFinland\n1.41\n0.89\n1.31\nUSA\n1.44\n0.95\n1.32\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n129\n120. The value of labor is estimated by applying a wage rate net of taxes and social security\ncontributions of a generalist household worker to the number of hours that persons spend on\nhousework. Methodology matters in this context and results can differ markedly depending in\nparticular on the hypotheses chosen for the valuation of labor40. Data on the wage rate for\nhousehold workers are drawn from the 2005 OECD/Eurostat Purchasing Power Parities price\ncollection. This wage rate is, however, only available for one year and for the present purpose,\na time series has to be constructed. We do so by taking the rate of change in the hourly wage\nfor each country’s ‘Other community, social and personal services’ industry, based on the\nassumption that household workers’ wages have evolved at the same pace as wages in the\nparent industry41. Thus, the value of household production will go up if these wage rates\nincrease and/or if the number of hours spent in housework go up. The value of household\nproduction will also increase if the price and/or the quantity of capital services from consumer\ndurables increase. \n121. The quantity of labor input is captured by the time spent in household work. As argued\nabove, there are also uncertainties about this evolution; furthermore, no consistent time-use\nsurveys exist over time. We therefore relied on two hypotheses of how this quantity has\nchanged over time: Variant A, where the time per day and per person allocated to household\nwork remains constant; and Variant B, where the time allocated to household work changes at\nthe same rate as the time allocated to paid work (which implies a decline in all countries). The\nmain rationale for Variant A is its simplicity – for want of better information on the evolution\nof household work, we take it to be unchanged. Variant B implies that housework is not a\nsubstitute to paid work, and that work and leisure operate as substitutes. Various alternative\nassumptions could be made but uncertainty could only be reduced through consistent time-\nuse observations.   \n122. The value of capital services is measured by constructing a stock of consumer durables\nand multiplying it by an imputed price of capital services for consumer durables42. The\nvolume input of capital services from consumer durables is captured by the net stock of\nconsumer durables. More details on the methods used to compute labor and capital services as\nwell as results are available from Annex A.\n123. A central implicit assumption in measuring the volume of household production by the\nvolume of labor and capital inputs is that there is no multifactor productivity (MFP) growth.\nA growth in MFP would imply that household labor and capital are combined more efficiently\n40.\nLandefeld, Fraumeni and Vojtech (2009) show alternative estimates of the value of household production for\nthe United States. Their estimate of household production for 2004 excluding services of consumer durables and\nowner-occupied housing, and using a housekeeper wage rate to value time spent on household production is 19%\nof conventionally measured GDP. Our own estimate excluding services of consumer durables for the United States\namounts to 22% of conventionally measured GDP for the year 2004. \n41.\nThere is no strong empirical justification for this choice. If the economy-wide development of wages is used\nto construct a time series, the resulting figures look quite different because economy-wide wages tended to rise\nquicker than wages in the community, social and personal services industry. The resulting estimates of the value of\nhousehold production are directly affected by this choice.\n42.\nThe housing services that households which owe their own dwellings provide to themselves are already\naccounted for in income measures in the national accounts. To avoid duplication they are not included here.\nHowever, it should be clear that the value of household work as presented here is not a complete characterisation\nof household own account production of services. \n\n130\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nin the production of household services. Note, however, that labor productivity may change if\nmore or less services from durables are used per unit of labor input. Annex A presents\ntherefore two variants, one without MFP growth, and one with an assumed MFP growth of\n0.5% per year.   \n124. The value of household services presented here is a first approximation. It is apparent,\nconsistently with previous studies, that imputations for own-account production of household\nservices are sizeable matter. Under the various assumptions made, household production\namounts to about 35% of conventionally-measured GDP in France (average 1995-2006),\nabout 32% in Finland and 30% in the United States43. The value of household production\ncomprises the value of household work (about 22% of GDP between 1995-2006 in the US,\nabout 30% in France and 29% in Finland) and the value of capital services provided by\nconsumer44 durables.\n125. Some of the time spent by households on unpaid work is devoted to produce goods for\ntheir own account such as growing vegetables, carrying out construction and maintenance\nactivities for their own dwellings. As the production values of these activities are already\nrecognized in the national accounts, our valuation implies an element of double-counting. For\nthe three countries under consideration, however, the size of this bias is likely to be small.\nThis may not be the case for countries in the developing world, where agricultural production\ncarried out by households for their own consumption may be a more important item. \n126. From a perspective of measuring living standards, it is also of interest to know by how\nmuch a broader measure of household production changes measured income and\nconsumption. And there, real measures over time and in international comparison are telling\nindicators. 9 shows comparisons of real income growth over the last decade or so. Accounting\nfor household production reduces the measured growth rates of real income in all three\ncountries by a significant margin. The general pattern of growth for each country is not\nmarkedly modified nor is the relative growth pattern between countries. Differences are,\nhowever, more important when comparing income levels across countries, as shown in . The\nfirst lines in this table show a comparison based on real adjusted disposable income (that is,\nan established national accounts aggregate), the third and fourth line compare real income\nincluding household production. Because household production is more important in France\nand Finland than in the United States, the new measure narrows the per capita gap in\nhousehold incomes between the two European countries and the United States. \n127. It is worth reiterating that many assumptions enter the comparisons presented here. The\nresulting numbers are therefore not on very solid, given the absence of ‘hard’ data throughout\nseveral steps in their computation. Thus, much care needs to be exercised to avoid over-\n43.\nThere are no annual observations for time use surveys. We generated such a series by using information on\nannual hours actually worked (on the labour market), based on labour force surveys. The trend in hours per person\nwas used to extrapolate backwards the hours spent on paid work as available from the ATUS and HETUS time use\nsurveys. Time spent on personal care was kept constant. Given annual observations for time other than paid work\nand personal care, the distinction was made between Variants A and B – time spent on housework constant and\ntime spent on housework changing at the same rate as time spent on paid work. Under each variant, the remaining\ntime was allocated to the remaining activities in the same proportions as observed in the latest years of the ATUS\nand HETUS time use surveys.  \n44.\nOver longer periods, durable goods will make little difference, since we include the value of these goods in\nGDP, and over the service life of durables, their (discounted) value is equal to the value of the services provided.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n131\ninterpretation of the results. This should not prevent official statistics from regularly\nestimating the full value of household production. Household satellite accounts would allow\naccommodating the lower data quality and frequency of these estimates. \n4.9. Valuing leisure\n128. Once one starts thinking about non-market income, one has to think about leisure. Time\nspent on generating income (market or non-market) provides the means to buy goods and\nservices to meet our needs, in addition to a range of non-market returns. Time available for\nleisure affects well-being in more direct ways. If follows that changes in the amount of leisure\nover time, and differences between countries, represent one of the more important aspects for\ncomparative assessment of economic well-being. Focusing only on goods and services can\nbias comparative measures of well-being towards the production of goods and services. This\nis of particular concern as the world begins to come to terms with environmental constraints:\nit will not be possible to increase the scale of economic production, especially of goods,\nbeyond limit. Taxes and regulations will be imposed that will both discourage the production\nof goods and change the way they are produced. It would be a mistake, beyond the decrease\nof production and consumption as they are currently recorded, not to consider that an increase\nin leisure time can benefit  well-being.\nTable 9: Real income of households, corrected for household production, 1995-2006\nPercentage change at annual rate\nSource: OECD estimates.\nTable 10: Real income of households, corrected for household production, 2005\nSource: OECD estimates.\n \nFrance\nUnited States\nFinland\nReal adjusted disposable income*\n2.2%\n3.1%\n2.5%\n1.9%\n2.9%\n2.2%\n*For private households and non-profit institutions serving households; net of depreciation.\n**'Income from household production' equals the value of the estimed labour and capital inputs used \n   by households to produce own-account services (except owner occupied housing); deflated \n   with price index for actual individual consumption corrected for household production\nReal adjusted disposable income*, corrected for household \nproduction**\nFrance\nUnited States\nFinland\nUSD per capita\n25378\n32110\n21771\nUSA=100\n79\n100\n68\nUSD per capita\n35037\n41904\n29208\nUSA=100\n84\n100\n70\n*For private households and non-profit institutions serving households; net of depreciation, converted with PPPs for actual individual consumption\n**'Income from household production' equals the value of the estimed labour and capital inputs used by households to produce own-account services\n   (except owner occupied housing); converted with PPPs for actual individual consumption corrected for household production\nReal adjusted disposable income* per capita, corrected \nfor household production**\nReal adjusted disposable income* per capita\n\n132\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n129.As society progresses, it is reasonable to expect that people will enjoy some of the fruits\nof that progress to in the form of leisure45. Stiglitz (forthcoming) observes that over the past\n30 years or so, Americans have hardly increased their leisure time, despite the large increase\nin the volume of goods and services at their disposal. He also notes the growing difference in\nleisure patterns between the United States and other countries and questions what this implies\nfor comparisons of living standards. Whatever the precise answer (which may well lie outside\nthe realm of traditional economics), it is the case that different societies may respond\ndifferently to the consumption-leisure choice, and we do not want to bias our judgments (e.g.\nof success) against societies that choose to enjoy leisure by excluding leisure from our\nmeasurement system.  \n130. It is difficult to put a monetary value on leisure. Economists have worked around this\nissue by treating leisure time like a consumer good whose price is the value of income from\nwork foregone46. Nordhaus and Tobin (1973) were among the first to make an explicit\nadjustment of national income measures for the value of leisure, recognising that more leisure\nadds to the well-being of persons. A number of measurement issues need to be addressed in\nthis context (Boarini et al. 2006). For example, leisure of a person who is constrained in his/\nher supply of additional labour on the labour market is not necessarily valued the same way as\nleisure of a person who is not constrained. The quantity of leisure is sometime difficult to\nidentify, due to the difficulty in drawing the borderline between personal care (sleeping etc.)\nand leisure. The exact valuation is also a matter of debate – which wage rate should be\nchosen? Should the quantity of leisure be adjusted for higher productivity (e.g. due to greater\navailability of consumer durables)? Lastly, there has been some debate how exactly to\nintegrate measures of leisure into standard measures of GDP and income47.    \n131. Many of these problems raised by this discussion are little different from those\ndiscussed in earlier sections, for instance concerning home production. Index number\nproblems are pervasive in all aspects of national income accounting, as are problems\nassociated with imputations for non-market activities. Even for market activities, we simply\nassume competitive market valuations, knowing full well that these assumptions are not\nappropriate in many key sectors of the economy. Similarly, in the case of non-market\n(government) production, we made implicit assumptions about the relative pace of\ntechnological change (relative to that in market activity). Markedly different results would\nobtain under different assumptions. There are, to be sure, problems in the measurement of\nleisure – just as there are problems in the measurement of time spent in home production.\nWhen is cooking a leisure activity, and when is it a substitute for market production?  \n132. Our approach towards measuring the leisure starts from time use data. The value of\nleisure per hour is measured by its opportunity cost, i.e., the wage foregone because a person\nengages in leisure rather than in paid work. This section provides some illustrative\n45.\nKeynes (1935).\n46.\nNordhaus and Tobin (1973).\n47.\nThe approach followed by Nordhaus and Tobin (1973) adds the value of leisure at constant prices to real\nGDP in both the initial and final year: as growth in leisure-time tends to be less than for real GDP (in the absence\nof productivity adjustments) the resulting leisure adjusted aggregate will typically increase by less than real GDP\n(the more so the larger the size of leisure relative to GDP). The approach suggested by Usher (1973) adds the\nchange in leisure-time to real GDP in the final year: when leisure increases over time, growth of .leisure-adjusted.\nGDP will exceed that of real GDP, even in the absence of productivity adjustments.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n133\ncalculations of the impact of leisure on our measurement system. These calculations are based\non a number of assumptions. First, we only value the leisure of the working age population,\nassuming that the opportunity cost for other parts of the population is zero. Second, we ignore\ndifferences in the value of leisure for working age people with different characteristics (e.g.\nan hour of leisure for a person that is considered as involuntary unemployed is valued in the\nsame way as for a person with a well-paid job working a long number of hours). Lastly, we\nvalue leisure based on the after-tax, average compensation of employees in each country.\nMultiplication of the average leisure time per day by the working age population and by the\nwage rate yields a measure of the total value of leisure. \n133. There are two issues with this computation. The first is a result of lack of data: no\ndistinction was made between employed, unemployed and inactive persons in their\nconsumption of leisure time per day. Socio-economic breakdowns of time use surveys show\nthat such differences exist. Employed persons tend to enjoy less leisure time than the average\nperson and inactive persons spend more time on leisure. The second problem concerns the\ntreatment of retired persons. Our method assumes zero opportunity cost for the population\nabove 64 which is incorrect in all those cases where persons in this cohort could work if they\nso wished. Conversely, there are persons in this cohort who are active on the labor market and\nassigning a zero value to their leisure implies understating the total value of leisure. However,\nthe empirical basis to discriminate between those retirees who are constrained in their choice\nof working and those who are not is weak. \n134. A second shortcoming in the calculation is the failure to discriminate between full-time\nand part-time employees. If part-time employment is a choice, more leisure associated with\npart-time work should be valued in terms of the wage foregone. Conversely, if part-time\nemployees are constrained in their choice, the additional leisure that these persons get should\nhave a lower valuation than otherwise. But since individuals could always choose to work in\nhome production, it is reasonable to assume that the value of leisure is at least equal to that\nimputed for home production – the opportunity cost of leisure. \n135. Finally, it must not be forgotten that an important objective in valuing leisure is to make\ncross-country comparisons: a given real income in a society with more leisure will typically\nimply a higher living standard than in a society with the same income but less leisure.\nWhether or not the complications in the measurement of leisure play out in international\ncomparisons, depends on the relative enjoyment of leisure between different groups –\nemployed (and inactive) versus unemployed, part-time versus full-time employment etc. –\nand on the relative occurrence of imposed leisure. If these proportions vary significantly\nacross countries, country comparisons will be affected. If the proportions are similar, cross-\ncountry comparisons will be affected to a lesser degree. But even “imposed” leisure may be\nvalued. Societal regulations or union bargaining that require, say, so many weeks of vacation\nreflect societal preferences. There are large differences across countries in the number of\nvacation days. More research needs to be conducted to reduce uncertainty around these\nquestions.\n136. For the three countries at hand, the value of leisure adds between 20 and 30 % to net\ndisposable income of households in nominal terms. More interesting than nominal income\nlevels is the question how leisure affects real income and consumption trends across\ncountries. Real measures are again obtained by applying a suitable price index to nominal\nmeasures. This price index now includes a component for the ‘price’ of leisure, i.e. wages\n\n134\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nforegone on the labor market. Results for annual growth rates are presented in 11. In\ncomparison with the measured rate of real income, the measure including leisure moves\nsignificantly more slowly. This is in line with earlier studies, where one finds that measures of\nincome with a large non-market component (such as household production and leisure) tend\nto exhibit higher levels, slower growth rates and less volatility48 than more narrowly defined,\nmarket-based measures of incomes and prices.\n137. Cross-country comparisons of living standards that reflect both household production\nand leisure (‘full income’- 12) are of interest because, ceteris paribus, societies with more\nleisure are better off than societies with less leisure: ignoring these differences means\nignoring one of the main components of social progress. Inclusion of leisure and non-market\nproduction of household services into a broader measure of living standards paints quite a\ndifferent picture of per capita income in the case of France relative to the United States –\ninstead of 79%, the income level of France is now at 87%. The effect is, however, marginal in\nthe case of Finland. This is not because Fins enjoy less leisure than Americans but because\nreal wages per hour (our measure to value leisure) are lower in Finland than in the United\nStates. 13, which compares the volume of leisure between France, the United States and\nFinland spells this out in more detail. The real value of leisure reflects several elements: real\nwage per hours worked, the leisure hours per working age person, the ratio between working\nage persons and the population as a whole. While there is about 10% more leisure per person\nconsumed in Finland than in the United States, this is offset by the fact that Finnish real wages\nonly amount to 59% of the U.S. level. One effect offsets the other, so that the real income\nlevels including and excluding leisure are relatively similar.          \n48.\nSome of the lower volatility is simply methodological as imputations don’t change; some is because, almost\nas a matter of definition, when market work is reduced, either non market production or leisure increases. This\nmay understate true magnitude of volatility by ignoring the costs/consequences of capital market constraints,\nwhich are ignored in the analysis.\nTable 11: Real income of households, corrected for household production and leisure\nPercentage change at annual rate, 1995-2006\nSource: OECD estimates.\n \nFrance\nUnited States\nFinland\nReal adjusted disposable income*\n2.2%\n3.1%\n2.5%\n1.4%\n2.3%\n1.4%\n*For private households and non-profit institutions serving households; net of depreciation.\n**'Income from household production' equals the value of the estimed labour and capital inputs used \n   by households to produce own-account services (except owner occupied housing); \n   leisure has been valued with the average after-tax wage of the working age population;\n   income has been deflated with a price index for actual individual consumption, adjusted for houshold production and leisure.\nReal adjusted disposable income*, corrected for household \nproduction and for leisure**\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n135\n138. The imprecision associated with the above estimates is again large. These are orders of\nmagnitude and should not be over-interpreted. However, it is also clear that recognition of\nleisure as one element for living standards does make a difference to comparisons over time\nand between countries. More work needs to be done to test methodologies, to single out the\nmost critical parameters and to test robustness of such measures. Only if there is sufficient\nconfidence in extended measures of income, will there be a broader take-up by statistical\noffices. \n139. Finally, we note that Krueger et al. (2008) and other researchers propose a different way\nof considering the effects of both the consumption of goods and service and of leisure. They\ndevelop a system of national time accounting where information on how people use time is\ncombined with information on the emotional experience during these activities. This\napproach holds open the promise of being able to distinguish among household production\nactivities which more rightly might be called “leisure” (cooking as an art form) and those\nwhich might more appropriately called production.49 Certain activities concern household\nproduction, and others concern leisure. The broader national time accounting index is a way\nof bringing these elements together in a single measure.\n4.10. Distribution of full income\n140. The rationale for examining distribution holds not only for market income but also for\nbroader measures such as full income. The recognition of own-account production of\nhousehold services may not only affect the aggregate measures of income and production but\nalso, in all probability, the established picture on its distributions a point made by Eisner\nTable 12: Real income of households, including household production and leisure, 2005\nSource: OECD estimates.\nTable 13: Decomposition of the real value of leisure in international comparison, 2005\nSource: OECD estimates.\n49.\nNote that in market production, no distinction is made between jobs that are enjoyable (and generate non-\npecuniary benefits) and those that are not. Some of these differences are reflected in wages. If a change in working\nconditions that made a job less enjoyable were reflected in a lower wage, national income would go down.  \nFrance\nUnited States\nFinland\nUSD per capita\n25378\n32110\n21771\nUSA=100\n79\n100\n68\nUSD per capita\n64708\n74571\n50021\nUSA=100\n87\n100\n67\n*For private households and non-profit institutions serving households; net of depreciation, converted with PPPs for actual individual consumption\n**'Income from household production' equals the value of the estimed labour and capital inputs used by households to produce own-account services\n   (except owner occupied housing); converted with PPPs for actual individual consumption corrected for household production and leisure\nReal adjusted disposable income* per capita\nReal adjusted disposable income* per capita, corrected \nfor household production and leisure**\nFrance\nUSA\nFinland\nValue of leisure in real terms per capita\nUSA=100\n91.9\n100.0\n65.3\nReal wage per hour\nUSA=100\n89.2\n100.0\n59.5\nLeisure per (working age) persUSA=100\n106.1\n100.0\n110.5\nWorking age/total population USA=100\n97.1\n100.0\n99.4\nWorking age/total population %\n65.1\n67.1\n66.7\n\n136\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n(1988) twenty years ago50. A more recent survey of the literature on this topic (Folbre,\nforthcoming) confirms the importance of considering household work when assessing\ndistributions of income and consumption.\n141.  Developing distributional measures of full income is, however, a formidable task. The\nsingle most difficult item is to allocate to various groups those income flows that have been\nimputed at the macro level. For example, imputed rents from own-occupied housing\nconstitute such an item. Other imputations for own-account services produced by households\nalso fall under this category. All these measures are typically absent from micro-estimates of\nincome.51 Accardo et al. (2009) is a recent example of such a work in France, but limited to\nhousehold disposable income. Household production and leisure are not taken into account.\n142. One could go further and ask, if other dimensions than income are deemed to be\nimportant in determining the well-being of an individual or a household, whether it is possible\nto take them into account when trying to derive a more comprehensive picture of the\ndistribution of living standards in society. This would be easy if some aggregate scalar\nrepresenting most dimensions of individual well-being were available. But it is unlikely that\nsuch aggregation would be possible without arbitrary assumptions on imputed prices.\nMoreover, it is also unlikely that all the information to compute such an aggregate indicator at\nthe individual level would be available in standard micro-data bases. Does this mean that\nconsiderations for distributional aspects of well-being should be limited to a few simple\neconomic variables like income or consumption expenditures? \n143. A multi-dimensional approach may help here by taking into account distributional\naspects of various dimensions of well-being. One application of this approach would consist\nin crossing data in these other dimensions of well-being with the ranking of individuals or\nhouseholds in the distribution of (real)52 money incomes, i.e. considering that money income\nis the main determinant of people’s well-being. For instance, introducing distributional\naspects into a non-monetary dimension like the consumption of public goods would simply\nrequire observing how much is consumed by people around the median of the money income\ndistribution as opposed to consumption per capita. The same could be done with the\nconsumption of leisure, own-account production, wealth or change in wealth, and more\ngenerally all individual or household characteristics in micro-data bases where information is\navailable to determine people at the median or other quantiles of money income - including\nsurveys on subjective matters like satisfaction and happiness. This would constitute an\nimprovement over present practices of focussing on averages.\n50.\n“Inclusion of non-market output may also bring significant changes to measures of income distribution, by\nsize, by sex, by age, and by rural-urban status. It is reasonable to conjecture that the proportions of income related\nto non-market output in the home are larger among the poor and among women, the aged, and those on farms or in\nrural areas. Full imputation of the value of education would appear likely to bring further dramatic changes in our\nviews of the distribution of saving and investment as well as of income.” (Eisner 1988, p. 1613).   \n51.\nIncome from owner-occupied housing is now being imputed in a number of European surveys. \n52.\nNote that the definition of the median individual or household in terms of real money income raises the issue\nof the price deflator to use. Presumably, income-dependent price deflators have to be used. They differ across\nincome levels because the weights of the various consumption goods vary with the level of income. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n137\nMain messages and recommendations\nRecommendation 1: Look at income and consumption rather than production.\n144. GDP is the most widely-used measure of economic activity. There are international\nstandards for its calculation, and much thought has gone into its statistical and conceptual\nbases. But GDP mainly measures market production, though it has often been treated as if it\nwere a measure of economic well-being. Conflating the two can lead to misleading\nindications about how well-off people are and entail the wrong policy decisions. Material\nliving standards are more closely associated with measures of real income and consumption –\nproduction can expand while income decreases or vice versa when account is taken of\ndepreciation, income flows into and out of a country, and differences between the prices of\noutput and the prices of consumer products.\nRecommendation 2: Consider income and consumption jointly with wealth.\n145. Income and consumption are crucial for assessing living standards, but in the end they\ncan only be truly gauged in conjunction with information on wealth. A vital indicator of the\nfinancial status of a firm is its balance sheet, and the same holds for the economy as a whole.\nTo construct the balance sheet of an economy, we need to have comprehensive accounts of its\nassets (physical capital – and probably even human, natural and social capital) and its\nliabilities (what is owed to other countries). Balance sheets for countries are not novel in\nconcept, but their availability is still limited and their construction should be promoted. There\nis also a need to “stress test” balance sheets with alternative valuations when market prices for\nassets are not available or are subject to bubbles and bursts. Note that measures of wealth are\nalso central to measuring sustainability. What is carried over into the future necessarily has to\nbe expressed as stocks – of physical, natural or human capital. Here too the right valuation of\nthese stocks plays a crucial role.    \nRecommendation 3: Emphasise the household perspective.\n146. While it is informative to track the performance of economies as a whole, trends in\ncitizens’ current material living standards are better followed through measures of household\nincome and consumption. Indeed, the available national accounts data shows that in a number\nof OECD countries real household income has grown quite differently from real GDP, and\ntypically at a lower rate. The household perspective entails taking account of payments\nbetween sectors, such as taxes going to government, social benefits coming from government,\nand interest payments on household loans going to financial corporations. Properly defined,\nhousehold income and consumption should also reflect the value of in-kind services provided\nby government, such as subsidized health care and educational services.  \nRecommendation 4: Give more prominence to the distribution of income, consumption and\nwealth.\n147. Average income, consumption and wealth are meaningful statistics, but they do not tell\nthe whole story about living standards. For example, a rise in average income could be\nunequal across income groups, leaving some households relatively worse-off than others.\nThus, average measures of income, consumption and wealth should be accompanied by\nindicators that reflect their distribution across persons or households. Ideally, such\n\n138\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\ninformation should not come in isolation but be linked, i.e. one would like information about\nhow well-off households are simultaneously with regard to all three dimensions of material\nliving standards: income, consumption and wealth. After all, a low-income household with\nabove-average wealth is not necessarily worse-off than a medium-income household with no\nwealth. The desirability of disposing of information on the “joint distribution” of dimensions\nwill be encountered once again in Recommendation 3 of the Chapter on the quality of life. \nRecommendation 5: Broaden income measures to non-market activities.\n148. There have been changes in how households and society function. For example, many\nof the services people received from other family members in the past are now purchased on\nthe market. This shift translates into a rise in income as measured in the national accounts and\nmay give a false impression of a change in living standards, while it merely reflects a shift\nfrom non-market to market provision of services. Many services that households produce for\nthemselves are not recognized in official income and production measures, yet they constitute\nan important aspect of economic activity. While their exclusion from official measures\nreflects uncertainty about data more than it does conceptual dissent, more and more\nsystematic work in this area should be undertaken. This should start with information on how\npeople spend their time that is comparable both over the years and across countries.\nComprehensive and periodic accounts of household activity as satellites to the core national\naccounts should complement the picture.\nREFERENCES\nAbraham, K.

However,\nalthough resources are clearly important for human well-being (they are discussed in Chapter\n1 of this report), they are also clearly insufficient, for reasons that are detailed in Box 2.1.\nHuman well-being depends on what resources enable people to do and to be, and the ability to\nconvert resources into a good life varies across people. This suggests that indicators that go\nbeyond being measures of income, wealth and consumption and incorporate the non-\nmonetary aspects of quality of life (hereafter referred to as QoL) have an important role to\nplay. The variety of these measures, and the lack of an obvious metric to compare\ndevelopments in the various dimensions, constitutes both the main advantage and the main\nlimit of these indicators.\nWhat constitutes a “good life” has occupied leading philosophers since Aristotle, and\ndozens of definitions of the “good life” are discussed in the literature: none of these\ndefinitions commands universal agreement, and each corresponds to a different philosophical\nperspective. The Commission’s goal in this area has not been to reach a shared understanding\nof what “quality of life” means but, rather, to identify areas where credible measures, based\non clear conventions and definitions, could be established.1 As a result, this report does not\naim to be comprehensive: attention is limited to areas where members of the Commission had\nspecific competencies and where available indicators allow drawing a more comprehensive\nassessment of QoL.\nBox 2.1. Is command over resources an adequate metric to assess human well-being?\nThe answer to this simple question is “no”. Indeed, all the approaches to quality of life described in this\nchapter share the view that people’s opulence (i.e. the quantity and features of the commodities that they\nhave at their disposal) does not offer an adequate perspective on human well-being. The standard\neconomic argument that changes in (suitable deflated) measures of real income or wealth lead to changes\nin the same direction of consumer satisfaction provides only a weak connection between resources and\nhuman well-being: it says something about the direction of change, but it does not inform about its\nmagnitude or about the level of well-being of individuals with different preferences. The standard\nargument that people’s command over resources is the relevant metric for determining how well-off\npeople are similarly ignores that people with different characteristics will have different capacities to\ntransform income or wealth into actual well-being, and that these differences cannot be ignored. \n1.\nThe term “quality of life” is used in this chapter to refer to those aspects of life that shape human well-being\nbeyond the command of economic resources.\n\n144\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nQuality-of-life approaches regard income or wealth, even when extended through imputations of\nadditional items, as an inadequate proxy of human well-being for a range of reasons:\n•\nFirst, many resources are unequally accessible to individuals, either because they are not marketed or\nbecause they come with different prices. Even when pricing is possible, the prices will differ across\nindividuals, which makes it problematic to compare real income across people (for example, when\nvaluing leisure for individuals with unequal wage rates).\n•\nSecond, many of the determinants of human well-being are not monetary resources but aspects of\npeople’s life circumstances (health, social networks, quality of institutions) or activities (home\nactivities, quality of work, leisure). It would be far-fetched to describe them as resources with\nimputable prices, even if individuals do make trade-offs among them.\n•\nThird, most approaches to human well-being reject the idea that command over resources is a suitable\nmetric even in the absence of the two previous points. Resources are means that are transformed into\nwell-being in ways that differ across people: people with greater capacities for enjoyment or greater\nabilities for achievement in valuable domains of life are better-off even if they command fewer\neconomic resources.\nThese arguments suggest that conventional, market-based measures of income, wealth and\nconsumption are insufficient to assess human well-being. They need to be complemented by non-monetary\nindicators of QoL.\nIn guiding its work, the starting point of the Commission has been an understanding of the\nmost important features that give life its value. QoL is often tied to the opportunities available\nto people, to the meaning and purpose they attach to their lives, and to the extent to which\nthey enjoy the possibilities available to them. QoL research has identified a rich array of\nattributes – such as belonging, fulfilment, self-image, autonomy, feelings, and the attitudes of\nothers – that are associated with QoL. Some of these attributes are intangible and difficult to\nevaluate. Others, however, have a more tangible character, and can be measured in reasonably\nvalid and reliable ways. In all cases, measuring QoL requires consideration of a\nmultidimensional array of indicators, which lack a unique metric that would allow simple\naggregation across dimensions: alternative approaches to the aggregation of this\nmultidimensional array of indicators are discussed at the end of this chapter.\nIn thinking about how best to measure QoL, it is necessary to choose some methodological\ncriteria. This chapter relies on a number of them. \n• First is the emphasis on people, on what they value as important for their daily life, and\non the environment in which they develop. Taking the individual as the fundamental\nunit of analysis does not imply neglecting communities and institutions, but requires\nevaluating them in virtue of what they bring to the QoL of the people participating in\nthem. This perspective also implies focusing on the “ends” of various human activities,\nwhile recognizing that their achievement can matter both intrinsically and\ninstrumentally (i.e. to achieve some other goal). \n• Second is a recognition of the diversities and inequalities in human conditions. This\ndiversity implies that societal well-being depends on both the aggregate level of the\nvarious items that shape people’s lives and on how they are distributed in society. The\nrelative importance attributed to these two aspects will depend on alternative\nconceptions of social justice.\n• Third is the view that quality of life depends on a variety of factors, with none of them\nclaiming absolute priority over the others. The multi-dimensional nature of quality of\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n145\nlife (as opposed to the scalar nature of income) increases the complexity of the analyses\nand raises a number of measurement issues. These pertain to whether to use comparable\ndimensions across people and countries, how to assess the importance of each\ndimension, which indicators to use to describe accomplishments in the various\ndimensions, how to present these indicators (e.g. in their raw form, or by standardizing\nthem in various ways), and whether and how to aggregate them.\n• Last is a focus on the present, rather than on the QoL of future generations; while the\nsustainability of QoL is an important issue, the factors that bear on this assessment are\ndescribed in Chapter 3. \nThe next section describes the main approaches to QoL that have the potential to deliver\nconcrete measures. The third section then reviews a number of objective domains that are\nboth broadly relevant for QoL and where credible measures should be developed through\nappropriate tools and adequate investment. The last section describes three cross-cutting\nthemes in the measurement of QoL, i.e. assessing the links between various domains,\naccounting for inequalities in individual experiences in each QoL domain, and providing a\nmore parsimonious description of QoL in each society by aggregating its various components.\nApproaches to measuring quality of life\nThree main conceptual approaches have proved useful in thinking about the measurement\nof QoL: the first is based on the notion of subjective well-being, the second on the notion of\ncapabilities, and the third on economic notions drawn from welfare economics and from the\ntheory of fair allocations. Each of these approaches informs different measurement strategies.\nWhile these approaches may represent opposite poles in intellectual terms, they all have a role\nto play in measuring QoL.\nSubjective well-being\nA long philosophical tradition views individuals as the best judges of their own conditions.\nIn economics, this approach is closely linked to the utilitarian tradition, which argues that\nQoL is reflected exclusively in the subjective states of each person. An approach based on\nsubjective self-reporting has broad appeal due to the strong presumption in many streams of\nancient and modern culture worldwide that making people “happy” and “satisfied” with their\nlives is a universal goal of human existence. Only a few years ago, the idea of measuring\npeople subjective states would have appeared incongruous. Today, several methods have\nmade subjective well-being amenable to systematic quantification (Kahneman, Diener and\nSchwartz, 1999). The greatest strength of this approach is its simplicity: relying on people’s\nown judgments is a convenient shortcut and potentially provides a natural way to aggregate\nvarious experiences in a way that reflects people’s own preferences. Further, this approach\nmakes it possible to reflect the diversity of people’s views about what is important in their\nlives.\nDistinct aspects of subjective well-being\nSubjective measures of well-being have been very prominent in recent discussions about\nmeasuring QoL, but this popularity has also generated some ambiguities and misconceptions.\nMost prominent among these is the assumption that all dimensions of subjective well-being\n\n146\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\ncan somehow be reduced to the single concept of “happiness”. In reality, as argued by Diener\n(1984), subjective well-being (SWB) is best understood as encompassing three separate\naspects: \n• life satisfaction, i.e. a person’s overall judgment about their life at a particular point in\ntime;\n• the presence of positive feelings or affect, i.e. the flow of positive emotions (such as\nfeeling happiness and joy, or a sense of vitality and energy) from moment to moment;\n• the absence of negative feelings or affect, i.e. the flow of negative emotions (such as\nfeeling angry, sad or depressed) from moment to moment.\nLife satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect are separate aspects of SWB, and\naccord with different conceptions of QoL. Satisfaction with life as a whole (and with\nparticular domains, such as work, housing and family life) involves an evaluative judgment of\nhow one’s life is faring, which requires making an effort and remembering past experiences.\nConversely, positive and negative affect involve measuring the hedonic experiences\nexperienced by people in real time, or shortly after these experiences have occurred.\nThese three aspects of subjective well-being are distinct. People who experience\nunpleasant feelings or physical pain could still be very satisfied with their lives if they value\nthe contributions that they feel they are making to society or to some other personal goal.\nLikewise, the presence of positive affect does not imply the absence of negative affect. Across\nindividuals, the correlation between life satisfaction and positive affect is only around 0.40;\neven after adjusting for day-to-day variability in the reports of life satisfaction and affect, the\ncorrelation is still below 0.60 (Krueger and Schkade, 2008). The correlation among different\nindicators of negative affect, such as anger and sadness, is also low at the individual level. \nWhich of these dimensions of SWB matters more – and for what – is still an open\nquestion. Much evidence suggests that people act to achieve satisfaction in their choices, and\nthat these choices are based on memories and evaluations. These memories and evaluations,\nhowever, can also lead to systematic errors and to choices that, in many fields, don’t improve\npeople’s QoL. In any case, it would be problematic to neglect people’s momentary feelings\nwhen considering their behaviour: some choices may be made unconsciously, rather than by\nweighing the pros and cons of all available alternatives, and relying on the current\nexperiences of other people may sometimes lead to choices that are better at promoting one’s\nown well-being than relying on predictions of our own emotional futures (Gilbert, 2005). The\nissue of which of these aspects of SWB has the bigger effect on health is similarly unresolved,\nwith some findings suggesting that the presence of positive affect is a more significant\ndeterminant of health than the absence of negative affect (with the exception of depression,\nJanicki-Deverts et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 2006).\nMeasurement approaches\nEach of these aspects of subjective well-being needs to be measured in the most\nappropriate way, as different survey questions can lead to different numerical results:\n• Data on life-evaluations have been collected in several representative surveys. In\nseveral cases (e.g. various waves of the World Values Survey), these measures are based\non qualitative responses, such as feeling “quite” or “fairly” happy with one’s life, or on\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n147\nother scales that assess life satisfaction. However, results based on qualitative response\ncategories are potentially affected by biases that limit cross-country comparability.\nConversely, the use of a visual (ladder-of-life) scale, with explicit reference points (10,\nfor the best possible life, and 0 for the worst possible life) has proved more effective in\neliciting a cognitive evaluation from respondents that is less vulnerable to comparability\nproblems. Even this formulation, however, does not assure the full comparability of\nanswers, as reference points may differ across time and people (Deaton, 2008). \n• Hedonic experiences are measured by a report that is made by each person either in real\ntime or shortly after an event has occurred. These measures have been collected less\nfrequently than life evaluations. Indeed, the gold standard method for collecting data on\nhedonic experiences in real time (Experience Sampling) has never been applied to a\nrepresentative population sample because it is burdensome.2 However, alternative\nmethods of collecting data on hedonic experiences, such as a telephone version of the\nDay Reconstruction Method, are less costly to implement, and investments should be\nmade to implement these approaches with representative samples.3 It is also important\nthat multiple dimensions of affect – such as feeling happy, sad, angry, tired or in pain –\nbe separately measured because they are distinct emotions, and that these measures be\ncollected periodically, so as to allow assessing changes over time.\nSome survey data that capture these three aspects of SWB already exist. For example, the\nGallup World Poll is a nationally-representative survey fielded in around 140 countries that\naims to better assess people’s experiences and well-being. Questions about life-evaluations\nare based on the (0 to 10) ladder-of-life scale, and the survey also includes questions on\nfeelings, both positive and negative, experienced the previous day. Across OECD countries,\nthe correlation between mean life-evaluations and the mean prevalence of positive affect\n(computed first by counting the number of positive experiences of each respondent and then\nby averaging these scores at the country level) is positive (0.67), while that between the mean\nprevalence of positive affect and of negative affect is negative (-0.26). However, in both\ncases, there is much variation across countries: in other words, the fact that most people in a\ncountry report a high life-satisfaction does not imply a high prevalence of positive affect,\nwhile a high prevalence of positive affect can go in hand with a high prevalence of negative\naffect.\nAs research progresses, it is likely that other aspects of SWB will be developed and\nmeasured. In this sense, both life satisfaction and hedonic experiences provide an incomplete\n2.\nThe term “experience sampling” refers to techniques involving the recording of participants’ experiences\nduring their daily lives; the term is sometimes used more broadly to designate any procedure involving: the\nassessment of experiences in natural settings; measurements that take place soon after the occurrence of the\nexperience reported; and measures on repeated time occasions. One concrete application of this method uses\nreports made by participants in response to a random signal (e.g. emitted by a pager) or at pre-determined times\nduring the day.\n3.\nThe Day Reconstruction Method asks respondents to reconstruct the previous day by completing a structured\nself-administered questionnaire. Respondents first reconstruct the previous day by producing a short diary\nconsisting of a sequence of episodes; next, they draw on their confidential diary to answer a series of questions\ndescribing each episode (i.e. when it began and ended, what they were doing, where they were, whom they were\ninteracting with, and how they felt on multiple affect dimensions). Respondents also answer a number of questions\nabout themselves and the circumstances of their lives (e.g., demographics, job characteristics, personality\nmeasures).\n\n148\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\ndescription of SWB. Nonetheless, they contain information that is not reflected in other\ncommon indicators, such as income. And they highlight patterns across people living in each\ncountry that differ sharply from those based on income measures: for example, in most\ndeveloped countries younger and older people report higher levels of life-satisfaction than\nprime-age individuals (Oswald, 1997), a pattern that contrasts sharply with the levels of\nincome of the same groups (which rise until prime age and then decline following retirement).\nThis suggests that these measures can play a useful role in measuring the QoL of people and\ngroups as complements of other indicators.\nDifferent aspects with distinct determinants\nOne of the most attractive promises of research on subjective well-being is to deliver not\njust a good measure of the level of QoL, but also a better understanding of its determinants, as\naffected by a variety of objective features (such as income, health status and education). \nThe set of determinants that is most relevant will depend on which aspect of subjective\nwell-being is considered. For example, across individuals, indicators of life circumstances\nsuch as household income and marital status are more strongly related to life satisfaction than\nto positive or negative affect, while features of daily experiences, such as time pressure at\nwork, are more strongly correlated with affect than with (work) satisfaction. The same\nconclusion applies across countries. For example, in a sample of over 130 countries surveyed\nby the Gallup Organization, the correlation between people’s income and their individual\nladder-of-life scores is 0.46; a similar correlation is found when looking at the national\naverage ladder score and the GDP per capita of each country. In contrast, the correlation\nbetween income and reports of affect is much lower, both across people within each country\nand between countries. The effects of world regions (defined by culture as well as geography)\non the ladder-of-life scores are mediated by GDP, but culture also has a direct effect on\nexpressions of affect. Relative to their GDP, the former communist countries are quite joyless,\nas are the Islamic countries; conversely, Latin American countries feature high levels of affect\n– both positive and negative. These results also indicate that the amount of time that people\nspend in contact with others is a prime determinant of the positive affect they report (see\nbelow).\nWhen considering the determinants of subjective well-being, one critical feature that\nmatters for the interpretation of these measures is adaptation. According to one view, each\nperson has a genetically-established personality, with given “set points” for various aspects of\nsubjective well-being; in this view, changes in external circumstances may lead to temporary\nchanges in subjective well-being, but subsequent adaptation will always force subjective\nwell-being back to each individual’s set point. While this reading of human nature would\nsuggest that there is very little that policies could do to ameliorate QoL for the human lot,\nmost proponents of this set-point view now seem to be leaning towards the view that the\nadaptation is less than complete. Even partial adaptation, however, has implications for\nsubjective measures of well-being, as the “hedonic treadmill” makes affect and evaluations\nsomewhat immune to objective life conditions. This, in itself, is not a weakness of the\nmeasure and could well reflect a fundamental feature of human nature (i.e. adaptability and\nresilience). However, it also suggests that measures based on subjective well-being may not\nbe sufficient for all social evaluations, especially when the desires and expectations of those\nwho are persistently deprived adjust to what they perceive as feasible: it is possible to be less\nsatisfied with a better life, if one has a more ambitious standard; similarly, when standards\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n149\nevolve in the same way as realizations, satisfaction levels at any given rank of society will\nremain roughly stable no matter what happens to the objective features that shape QoL.4 \nAnother determinant of subjective well-being that has generated much research and\ncontroversy relates to the importance of peer effects and relative comparisons. Discussions in\nthis field have been driven by the observation, by Easterlin that long-term gains in income and\nmaterial prosperity were not followed by similar gains in life-evaluations. One way to explain\nthis paradox is the hypothesis that income gains relative to other people within a community\nmatter more for these life-evaluations than country-wide improvements in absolute income.\nBetter measures of SWB have helped to dispel some of these old controversies. An important\nresult of recent research is that the Easterlin paradox does not apply to cross-country\ncomparisons of life evaluation at the world level (Stevenson and Wolfers, 2008; Deaton,\n2008). In other words: i) countries with a higher level of GDP per capita do report higher life-\nevaluations; ii) the relationship between life-evaluations and the logarithm of GDP is broadly\nlinear (i.e. it does not flatten out at higher income levels beyond the flattening that is implicit\nin the log-linear relation between the two variables); and iii) the relation between country-\nlevel GDP and average life-evaluations is similar to the one that applies to individuals’\nincome and their own life-evaluations in each country. \nSimilarly, in a set of 18 countries, Diener and Kahneman (unpublished work) found that\nthe correlation between changes in GDP and changes in the ladder-of-life scores about 30\nyears apart was 0.58; and, further, that the regression of national ladder scores on GDP was\nalmost exactly the same at the two points in time. This suggests that the standard for “the best\npossible life” is not only shared across countries but is also remarkably stable over time.\nOther researchers, however, report evidence that relative income matters, based on different\nmeasures of subjective well-being, different surveys, and different selections of countries\n(Luttmer, 2005; Clark, Frijters and Shields, 2008; Helliwell, 2008; Layard et al., 2008; Frank,\n2008). Further, the Easterlin paradox may still apply to affect, implying that as countries get\nricher people will not necessarily report lower prevalence of negative feelings, or a higher\nprevalence of positive ones. More generally, while the debate on the ways in which income\ninfluences subjective well-being is likely to continue as better data became available, the\nresults provided by Diener (1984), Di Tella et al. (2003) and Wolfers (2003) highlight that a\nrange of factors beyond income shape life-evaluations: these factors include both personal\ncharacteristics (age, gender, marital status, perceptions of corruption and availability of social\nsupport) and macro-economic and contextual effects (as measured by national averages of\nvariables already included at the individual level). Yet many puzzles remain, including the\nfact that, at least in some contexts, the health status of respondents does not appear to affect\ntheir life satisfaction (Deaton, 2008; Deaton, Fortson and Tortora, 2009). In other terms,\nsurvey measures of subjective well-being do not always appear to behave in ways that we\nwould expect them to in order to trust them at face value. \nOne aspect where all research on subjective well-being does agree concerns the high\nhuman costs associated with unemployment. Unemployed people report lower life-\nevaluations than do the employed even after controlling for their lower income, a pattern that\n4.\n“Combined with other evidence on the validity of life satisfaction measures, the widespread evidence on\nadaptation suggests to us that subjective well-being is not mainly a matter of income and consumption\nopportunities.” (Kahneman and Krueger, 2006). This conclusion makes it harder for life satisfaction to be a\nconsensual indicator of QoL, as many people resist the view that mental comfort is all that matters in life. \n\n150\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nholds both when looking at cross-sectional data (Clark and Oswald, 1994; Blanchflower,\n2008) and when following the same person over time (Winkelman and Winkelman, 1998);\nthis pattern suggests the existence of non-pecuniary costs of unemployment, such as loss of\nfriendship, meaning and status. There is also evidence that high unemployment also\nnegatively affects people who retain their jobs, and that the gap in life-satisfaction between\nthe unemployed and the employed has increased slightly in European countries (Di Tella et al,\n2003). Evidence for a large sample of Europeans and non-Europeans also shows that the\nunemployed report feeling more sadness, stress and pain than the employed (Krueger and\nMueller, 2008), with sadness being particularly high when searching for jobs and watching\ntelevision (an activity that is conventionally classified as “leisure” in time-use surveys). Some\nresearch also finds that unemployment is more costly than inflation in terms of the impact on\nsubjective well-being (Blanchflower, 2008): while there is much debate on the robustness of\nsome of these findings, they do suggests prima facie that the cost of recessions (in terms of\nhigher unemployment) could exceed those implied by more conventional macro-economic\nmeasures, such as the “misery index” (i.e. the sum of the unemployment and inflation rates).\nA general difficulty for the study of the determinants of subjective well-being is to\ndistinguish between causes and correlates. For example, the fact that the unemployed report\nlower life-evaluations as a whole may be because the experience of being unemployed lowers\nthese evaluations (in which case, unemployment causes life-evaluations); or that people\nreporting lower life-evaluations are more likely to quit their jobs or to remain unemployed for\nlonger (in which case, cognitive evaluations cause unemployment); or that people more\naffected by neurosis (a personality trait) are unstable in their jobs and report lower life-\nevaluations than others (in which case, a third factor shapes both cognitive evaluations and\nthe experience of unemployment). The same difficulty applies when studying the\ndeterminants of a range of other features of QoL (e.g. health) discussed in this chapter. \nStrengths and weaknesses\nOne intrinsic limitation of all measures of SWB is that reported data cannot be validated\nagainst objective measures of the same phenomena, for the simple reason that no obvious\nexternal benchmark for these phenomena exists. However, indirect attempts to validate\nmeasures of SWB, such as by comparing people’s self-reported SWB with the frequency and\nintensity of people’s smiles or with reports provided by other persons, do confirm that these\nsubjective measures have some validity against these benchmarks (Krueger et al., 2008). A\nsimilar conclusion can be drawn from evidence that many of the coefficients relating\nsubjective well-being measures to various determinants are quite similar across countries.5\nTwo of the most important weaknesses of SWB relate to interpersonal comparability and\n(in the case of life-evaluations) the possibility that external events may disturb evaluations\nand their measures.\n• Different individuals could use the scales differently. This may not be very important\nfor the estimation of “averages” of SWB over culturally homogeneous populations but\nis more of a problem for the measurement of dispersion within a country. The problem\nof heterogeneous standards could be partly alleviated by asking respondents to describe\n5.\nThere are, however, exceptions, in terms of both the significance of some determinants (e.g. religion) across\ncountries and the strength of their association with subjective well-being (e.g. age). \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n151\nthe standards that they use when judging a specific situation, but the application of these\nmethods remains rare. \n• Making a global evaluation of one’s life is not always easy: people need to make a\ncognitive effort to provide an answer, and some surveys may fail to put respondents in\ngood conditions to ponder the issues. Also, answers may be polluted by current moods\n(finding a dime a few minutes before the interview, or the state of the weather) or by the\norder in which questions are posed (asking about dating before posing questions on life-\nevaluation). More knowledge about the validity of these subjective measures could also\nbe developed by studying how evaluations vary with the time people are given to think\nabout the issue, and the detail with which they are asked to justify their evaluations. \nBut, overall, the overwhelming conclusion that we derive from existing analyses of\nvarious aspects of subjective well-being is that these measures tap into QoL in meaningful\nways, despite the persistence of many unresolved issues about the relationship between the\nvarious measures and the aspects of human experience that are not captured by these\nsubjective measures. The type of questions that have proved their value within small-scale,\nunofficial surveys should start being included in larger-scale surveys undertaken by official\nstatistical offices.\nCapabilities6\nWhile psychological studies of QoL focus on people’s own feelings, other approaches\nbroaden the information set relevant for valuing people’s lives, beyond their self-reports and\nperceptions. The most prominent of these approaches is rooted in the notion of “capabilities”\n(Sen, 1987b, 1993). This approach conceives a person’s life as a combination of various\n“doings and beings” (functionings), and assesses QoL in terms of a person’s freedom to\nchoose among the various combinations of these functionings (capabilities). \n• Functionings is a broad term used to refer to the activities and situations that people\nspontaneously recognize to be important. These can also be conceived as a collection of\nthe observable achievements of each person (e.g. their health, knowledge or having a\nmeaningful job). Some of these achievements can be quite elementary, such as being\nsafe and well-nourished, and others quite complex, such as being able to express oneself\nin public without shame. As people in different places and times have different values\nand experiences, the list of the most relevant functionings depends on circumstances\nand on the purpose of the exercise. In this perspective, the well-being of a person is a\nsummary index of the person’s functionings.\n• Freedom requires expanding the range of information relevant for assessing people’s\nlives beyond their observed achievements, to the full range of opportunities open to\nthem. The limits of focusing on achievements for assessing QoL become obvious when\nconsidering cases where a low observed functioning (e.g. low calorie intake) reflects a\nchoice (as in the case of fasting) or where a high level of functioning reflects the choices\nof a benevolent dictator. The concept of freedom emphasises the importance of\nempowering people to help themselves, and of focusing on individuals as the actors of\ntheir own development. \n6.\nThis section draws on a paper prepared for the Commission by Sabina Alkire (Alkire, 2008).\n\n152\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nThe intellectual foundations of the capability approach include a number of notions. First\nis a focus on human ends, and on the importance of respecting people’s ability to pursue and\nrealise the goals that he or she values. Second is the rejection of the economic model of\nindividuals acting to maximize their self-interest heedless of relationships and emotions, and\na recognition of the diversity of human needs and priorities. Third is an emphasis on the\ncomplementarities between the various capabilities for the same person (while valuable in\nthemselves, many of these capabilities are also means of expanding others, and leveraging\nthese interconnections increases quality of life) and their dependence on the characteristics of\nothers and on the environment where people live (e.g. illness may spread from one person to\nanother and be influenced by public health and medical programmes). A last feature of the\ncapability approach is the role played by moral considerations and ethical principles, and its\ncentral concern with justice, in the form of either bringing each person above a given\nthreshold for each capability, or assuring equal opportunities to all in the “capability space”\n(Alkire 2003). \nThe implications of the capability approach are not limited to the measurement of QoL but\nextend to the evaluation of policies. Policies supportive of human development should expand\nthe opportunities available to people, which would be valuable irrespectively of the effect on\npeople’s subjective states.7 While subjective states may be considered as being part of the set\nof capabilities considered, the capability approach emphasises that people may adapt to their\nlife-circumstances, and that this adaptation makes subjective feelings inadequate as the sole\nmetric for assessing QoL.\nThe practical implementation of the capability approach requires taking a number of steps.\nA first one is choosing among dimensions. While some authors have strongly argued in\nfavour of specifying a single list of “central” capabilities as a necessary step to make the\ncapability approach operational8, others have argued against “freezing” a list of capabilities\nbased on expert views. In practice, most of the methods used in empirical applications of this\napproach select dimensions (or capabilities) based on the following: what type of data are\nactually available; a priori assumptions about what people do or should value; existing lists\nthat have achieved some degree of political legitimacy (e.g. universal human rights, the\nMillennium Development Goals); surveys on what people value as important; and\nparticipatory processes that periodically elicit people’s values and perspectives (Alkire,\n2008). \n7.\nThis will apply even when measures of subjective states do reflect changes in objective features of QoL.\n8.\nNussbaum (2000) lists the following ten “central human functional capabilities”: i) life, i.e. being able to live\nto the end of a human life of normal length; ii) body health, i.e. having good health and shelter, and being\nadequately nourished; iii) bodily integrity, i.e. being able to move freely, being secure against assault and violence,\nhaving opportunities for sexual satisfaction and choice in matters of reproduction; iv) senses, imagination and\nthought, which include the ability to do things in an informed and cultivated way, to use one’s mind in ways\nprotected by guarantees of freedom, to have pleasurable experiences and avoid unnecessary pain; v) emotions,\nsuch as to love, grieve, experience longing, gratitude and anger; vi) practical reason, i.e. being able to form a\nconception of the good and to engage in critical reflection about the planning of one’s life; vii) affiliation, in terms\nof being able to live for and towards others and having the social basis of self-respect and non-humiliation; viii)\nother species, in the sense of being able to live with concern for and in relation to the world of nature; xi) play, i.e.\nbeing able to laugh, play and enjoy recreational activities; and x) control over one’s environment, in terms of being\nable both to participate in political choices that govern one’s life and to hold property, both formally and in terms\nof real opportunities.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n153\nA second practical step in the implementation of this approach is getting data and\ninformation on these various dimensions. Here a practical difficulty is that most data\ngenerally refer to functionings (i.e. description of individuals’ states) rather than to\ncapabilities (i.e. the set of opportunities that are available to each person). However, many\nfunctionings, such as health and education, also determine capabilities (to consume, to move,\nto participate), while some data may directly refer to people’s rights and freedoms (e.g. to\nparticipate in political decision-making, to join organizations at work and in society). In\naddition, information on capabilities is sometimes available from surveys that probe\nrespondents for their reason for not doing something (i.e. whether people did not consume\nmore of a good because of preferences or constraints) or through additional information on\nthe extent of choice that people have. More generally, one can imagine a broader framework\nin which both capabilities and achieved functionings serve to describe individual situations\n(Sen, 1985 and 1992).\nA third step in the implementation of this approach involves valuing the different\ncapabilities. This valuation allows converting the vector of functionings and capabilities into\na scalar measure of well-being or advantage. While this step raises a number of difficult\nissues (which are further discussed in the last section of this chapter), the capability approach\nemphasises that several sources of information can be used, separately or jointly, for that\nvaluation (e.g. survey-data on SWB provide evidence on valuation), that people may differ in\ntheir valuation of a given vector of functionings and capabilities, and that such differences\nmay imply recognizing the “partial” nature of these rankings (i.e. two persons may agree that\nboth states A and B are superior to C, while disagreeing on the ranking of A and B); in these\nconditions, the intersection of these partial orderings may reflect the minimum that could\nsafely be said while respecting both the incompleteness and conflicts of people’s valuations\n(Sen, 1987b).\nIn practice, a large body of empirical research has drawn inspiration from the capability\napproach. The “human development index” launched by the UNDP in 1990 is rooted in a\nnotion of development conceived as a process of enlarging people’s choices and\nopportunities. More recently, the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative has\naimed to develop specific survey questions (on employment, empowerment, safety and\nsecurity, meaning and value, and ability to go without shame) to give operational content to a\nmeasure of poverty in a space of capabilities.9 \nEconomic approaches: welfare economics and fair allocations\nSubjective well-being and capabilities have developed in close connection with disciplines\nother than economics (psychology for the former, moral philosophy for the latter). In the\neconomics field, the welfare economics tradition and the theory of fair allocation propose\nother ways of addressing the issue of how to include non-market aspects of QoL into a\nbroader measure of well-being. The fundamental goal of these approaches is to respect\nindividual preferences in the weighting of the various dimensions of QoL. These approaches\nare based on consumer theory, in which preferences are described by indifference sets (i.e.\nsets containing all situations in which the individual is indifferent). While consumer theory\n9.\nSee http://www.ophi.org.uk/ .\n\n154\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nusually bears only on the consumption of goods and services, the same approach can be\nextended to other aspects of QoL.\nWelfare economics has traditionally relied on the notion of “willingness-to-pay” to extend\nthe scope of monetary measures to non-market aspects of life (Boadway and Bruce, 1984).\nPeople make trade-offs between different dimensions of their situation, and this allows\nrelating changes in their QoL to changes in their income that are equivalent according to their\nown preferences (i.e. their willingness-to-pay to achieve a given level of health, education or\nexposure to pollution). This approach, however, has been severely criticized because of the\npotential inconsistency in the conclusions it produces and because evaluations based on total\nwillingness-to-pay may disproportionately reflect the preferences of those who are better-off\nin society (Box 2.2).\nBox 2.2. Welfare economics and the sum of people’s willingness-to-pay\nIt is common in cost-benefit analyses to add up people’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) in order to evaluate\nwhether a change in their situations is good or not from the perspective of society as a whole. This\napproach has been used to evaluate past improvements in health and life expectancy in terms of equivalent\nincrements in wealth or income (Becker et al., 2005; Murphy and Topel, 2006).10 For example, one\napplication of this approach concludes that the value of the gains in life expectancy realized in the United\nStates over the past century is about as large as the value of all other consumption goods and services\ntogether (Nordhaus, 2002). Some of the main weaknesses of this sum-of-WTP approach are as follows:\n•\nFirst, the references it takes for the non-income dimensions of life may vary with the comparison at\nhand (typically, either the initial or the final values).11 This implies that it may be possible that the total\nWTP is positive when considering a move both from situation A to B as well as from situation B to A.\n•\nSecond, by adding WTP across individuals, this approach does not give any priority to the worst-off.\nThis approach favours the rich, whose WTP is greater because of the presence of income effects.\nBecause of these drawbacks, most welfare theorists regard this approach as inappropriate, although it\nremains influential in applied cost-benefit analysis, as used for industrial policy, international economics\nand health economics. More generally, studies showing the total WTP for a change in QoL are informative\nabout the relative importance of changes in various non-monetary dimensions of QoL compared to\nincome. However, they cannot be used to evaluate changes globally or to guide policy decisions.\nThe theory of fair allocations overcomes some of the weaknesses of welfare economics by\nexplicitly referring to equity criteria.12 This theory has also inspired several methods for\ncomparing individuals’ multidimensional situations in a way that respects their preferences\n(Moulin and Thomson 1997; Maniquet 2007). In this tradition, a particular method (the\n10.\nFor example, the change from a state characterised by an average annual income of €15,000 and by 65 years\nof average life expectancy, to a state where average income is €30,000 and average life expectancy is 75 years,\nmight be equivalent, in terms of summing up individuals’ willingness-to-pay, to moving to a situation where\nincome rises to €55,000 and life expectancy remains at 65 years.\n11.\nWhen the initial values are taken as a reference, this approach computes the “equivalent variation” of\nincome; when the final values are taken as a reference, this approach computes the “compensating variation”, i.e.\nwhat sacrifice in income would bring the individual back to the state of initial satisfaction.\n12.\nThe theory of fair allocations studies the allocation of resources among people with different tastes and\nabilities, subject to a number of fairness criteria, such as “no-envy” (i.e. no agent should prefer another’s bundle),\n“solidarity” (e.g. no agent should be hurt by an increase in available resources) and “lower-bounds” (e.g. no agent\nshould prefer the equal-split solutions, Fleurbaey, 2008b).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n155\n“equivalence approach”) might be the most suitable for applications. This method consists in\nselecting a “reference” set of individual situations that are easy to rank from better to worse\n(typically selected so that a better situation dominates a worse one in all aspects of QoL); then\nthe conditions of any given person are assessed by identifying the particular situation in this\nreference set that is equivalent to his current situation according to his own preferences. For\ninstance, if two individuals are indifferent with respect to their current situation and the same\nsituation in the reference set, they are considered to be equally well-off. This approach\nrequires, in addition to information about preferences, the choice of a specific reference set.\nAn example consists of taking as a reference a set of situations that are identical in all non-\nmarket aspects of QoL and differ only with respect to income; in this case, people could be\ncompared in terms of their “equivalent income”, i.e. the income they would have in their\nequivalent situations (which differ only in respect to income, and share the chosen reference\nvalues for the non-monetary aspects of QoL). This approach – which builds on the Bergson-\nSamuelson approach to welfare economics13 – makes it possible to use a monetary metric for\nmeasuring non-market aspects of QoL. The economic approaches described in this subsection\nrequire data on individual preferences that are not easy to assess: various methods for\ncollecting suitable data are described at the end of this chapter.\nRelations between the various approaches\nAll the approaches described here address the difficulty of bringing together the various\naspects of QoL. The subjective well-being approach focuses on subjective and mental states,\nand incorporates all other aspects of QoL in the analyses as potential determinants of well-\nbeing, by measuring how they impact individual perceptions. The approaches drawn from the\ntradition of welfare economics and from the theory of fair allocations also build on subjective\nviews about the various aspects of QoL but seek to evaluate QoL itself, taken as an object of\nindividual preferences rather than as a subjective output.14 Conversely, the capability\napproach recognizes genuinely distinct, plural and incommensurable achievements. Because\nof this, proponents of this approach are generally reluctant to engage in the construction of\nindices that summarize the evaluation of an individual situation into a single number,\nalthough some methods of aggregation that draw on this perspective are discussed by\nproponents of this approach. Subjective well-being may also be viewed as multidimensional\nif one considers that evaluative judgements, positive affect and negative affect are all distinct\naspects of subjective well-being.\nChoosing between these approaches is ultimately a normative decision. It depends on what\naspects of life are deemed to be most relevant in the evaluation of QoL. Subjective well-being\n13.\nNeither Bergson nor Samuelson committed themselves to specific indexing methods, although money-metric\nutilities and other indices of the equivalent sort were provided as examples by Samuelson. The equivalent income\n(or “money-metric utility”) approach has been advocated by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) and by King (1983).\nFor a discussion of specific criticisms that this method has attracted from social choice theorists, see Fleurbaey\n(2008a).\n14.\nTo illustrate, if one thinks of any given aspect of subjective well-being (life-evaluation, positive or negative\naffects) as measuring some kind of “utility function” U(x), where x represents all the aspects of an individual’s\nsituation that matter to the individual, the subjective well-being approaches work with the units of U (which may\ndiffer depending on the specific aspects of subjective well-being under consideration), while the economic\napproaches evaluate x. So does the capability approach, provided that x is sufficiently comprehensive and\nincorporates what the individual is able to do, not just what he achieves.\n\n156\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nmay be considered as encompassing all key capabilities, while focusing on their impact on\npeople’s subjective states. Conversely, the capability approach treats subjective well-being as\njust one aspect of QoL among the many capabilities that people have reasons to value. The\neconomic approaches are somewhere in between, as they seek to weight the various aspects of\nQoL without assuming a priori that subjective well-being takes full weight; further, contrary\nto the capability approach, these approaches insist on relying on people’s own preferences. It\nshould be stressed, however, that the difference between the capability approach and the one\nbased on notions of fairness is rather thin, as both share a focus on equality across all\nmembers of society. Finally, subjective well-being, capabilities, and fair allocations have\ndeveloped fairly recently. The progress achieved in these fields provides a real opportunity\ntoday to make progress in measuring QoL.\nFeatures of quality of life\nIn practice, all approaches to QoL share an emphasis on a range of features in people’s\nlives that are important either intrinsically, as objective expressions of a good life, or\ninstrumentally, to achieve valuable subjective states or other objective goals. Some of these\nfeatures may be conceived as referring to particular functionings (i.e. descriptions of people’s\ndoings – e.g. working, commuting – and beings – e.g. being healthy or educated) while others\nmay be conceived as freedoms in particular domains (e.g. political voce and participation). \nDetermining which elements should belong to this list of QoL features (i.e. the choice of a\n“space” for QoL evaluations) inevitably depends on value judgements about which aspects\nare of greater importance at a given place and time, and on the purpose of the exercise (e.g.\nwhether we want to describe developments within each country, or to compare countries at\ndifferent levels of development) but also on judgements.15 In principle, this judgement can\nonly be based on deliberative processes, whereby people in various communities identify\nthose aspects that most directly bear on their living conditions. In practice, practical\nexperiences with these deliberative processes highlight a number of themes that are shared\nacross a large number of constituencies; a similar degree of consistency also emerges when\ncomparing the “frameworks” developed under various initiatives that focus on measuring\nbroad concepts such as “well-being”, “human development”, and “societal progress”.16 In\nmost cases, these themes include not just the measures of people’s subjective states described\nabove, but also measures of their health and education, their daily activities, their\nparticipation in political processes, and the social and natural environment in which people\nare embedded and which shape their sense of security. The existence of these recurrent\nthemes opens the way to comparisons of quality of life across people and countries.\nHealth\nHealth is perhaps the most fundamental component of capabilities as, without life, none of\nthe other components has any value. And yet, as noted by Wolfson (1999), we know far more\n15.\nAs argued by John Hicks: “In order that we should be able to say useful things about what is happening,\nbefore it is too late, ... we must concentrate our attention, and hope that we have concentrated it in the right place”\n(quoted in Alkire, 2009).\n16.\nSee, as an example, the taxonomy developed in the context of the OECD-hosted “Global Project on\nMeasuring the Progress of Societies”, available at www.oecd.org/progress/taxonomy.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n157\nabout the costs of health care, and the number of patients treated, than we know about the\nimpacts of the treatment, and the health status of the population in general. Health impacts on\nboth the length of life and its quality. While a fairly wide range of data are available on the\nformer, measurement challenges remain much more important on the latter. While a basic\ninfrastructure of health statistics is in place in most of the world’s countries, this is by no\nmeans universal. Further, adequate measures are still lacking in several domains.\nMortality\nMortality is better-measured and less subject to error than other health measures. Mortality\nstatistics hence constitute the basic indicator of a population’s health status, and many\nresearchers rely only on mortality-based measures to look at population health. Since 1960,\nthe mortality rates of both infants and adult men have declined significantly, with a more\nmoderate decline for adult women, partly reflecting differences in smoking behaviour (Figure\n2.1). The gains are even sharper over a longer time-period: for example, infant mortality rates\nin the United States declined from 100 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1915 to around 7 by the\nmid-2000s, while in France the decline over a similar period was from above 140 to around 4.\nHowever, even mortality statistics have problems.\nFirst of all, mortality rates by age and gender require complete vital registration systems.\nThese are available in all developed countries as well as in some countries in Latin America\n(whose registration systems are close to complete), but not elsewhere. In poor countries,\ninfant mortality rates are reasonably well estimated from surveys, and some countries (such as\nIndia) have a sample registration system or ask questions in their population censuses\n(China). But for much of the world there is a huge gap in available measures of adult\nmortality rates, a gap that is a giant problem for thinking about HIV/AIDS in Africa, for\nexample. Adult mortality rates there and other statistics based on them are modelled, rather\nthan measured, by international agencies, typically based on infant mortality rates and on\nFigure 2.1. Trends in infant and adult mortality in selected countries\nSource: OECD Health data.\n \nInfant mortality, deaths per 1,000 live births\nDeath rate for men and w omen aged 50-54, deaths per 1,000 population\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n1960\n1970\n1980\n1990\n2000\nAustralia\nFrance\nUnited States\nOECD\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n1960\n1970\n1980\n1990\n2000\nAustralia, men\nFrance, men\nUnited States, men\nAustralia, women\nFrance, women\nUnited States, women\n\n158\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nassumptions about AIDS mortality.17 The wide margins of error implicit in these estimations\nare not always recognized. It follows that for much of the world international measures of\nhealth status that depend on adult mortality are deeply problematic, making it impossible to\nmonitor current efforts to improve global health. Historical comparisons even for developed\ncountries (such as those mentioned above) raise similar problems; the United States, for\nexample, has had a complete registration system at the federal level only since the 1930s\n(Hetzel, 1997). \nA second problem is how best to construct summary statistics based on mortality data.\nMortality rates are vectors, not scalars, i.e. one number per age and gender. To get an overall\npopulation measure requires the use of some aggregation formulas. In general, crude\nmortality rates (mortality divided by population) are not useful indicators of population\nhealth, as they depend on the age structure of the population. Several types of aggregation\nformulas are currently used, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\n• Life expectancy at birth is the imaginary expectation of life for someone born today\nwho will experience today’s age-specific mortality rates throughout life. While this\nmeasure is the most common indicator of health conditions, it understates how long\nsomeone born today can expect to live if mortality rates continue to fall (and,\nconversely, it overstates it in those countries where mortality rates are projected to rise).\nAlso, the effects of lower mortality on life expectancy depend on the age at which the\nmortality decline takes place. In particular, changes in life expectancy will be larger the\nearlier the age at which the decline in mortality takes place. This has implications for\ntime-series comparisons. For example, in the 1950s, vector control and immunization\ncampaigns in poor countries led to big declines in infant and childhood mortality,\nwhereas the big declines in mortality in rich countries have been among the middle-\naged and the elderly. These developments had the effect of sharply narrowing the gap in\nlife expectancy at birth between rich and poor countries. However, this narrowing also\nhides an important philosophical issue, i.e. whether a decline in mortality rates among\nnewborn infants is indeed “better” than a decline in mortality among middle-aged\npeople. Answers to this question also depend on the fertility declines that typically\nfollow lower mortality rates in poor countries (Deaton, 2006).\n• Standardized mortality rates. Mortality rates of different age groups should be\ncombined in ways that do not unduly reflect differences in age structure between\ncountries and periods. However, different methods to achieve this standardization can\nbe used, and results may differ depending on the properties of the underlying data. Two\nfrequently used measures are “direct” and “indirect” standardization. Both methods\napply the mortality structure of a place or time to a reference population. For the United\nStates, for example, the mortality rate of a given state (e.g. Florida) could be “directly\nstandardized” by calculating the fraction of the population that would have died had\n17.\nInfant mortality (annual deaths under age one, expressed per 1,000 live births) is a long-standing health\nindicator. It is of value in that it reflects the effects of economic and social conditions on the health of mothers and\nnewborns, as well as the effectiveness of health systems. It is commonly included in all evaluations of living\nstandards, being inversely related to per capita GDP. Infant mortality is an important indicator in developing\ncountries and a cornerstone of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, for example, but less so in\ndeveloped countries, where small cross-country differences around very low levels may reflect differences in\nmedical and recording practices.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n159\nFlorida’s age-specific mortality rates held but the US age-structure of the population\napplied. Or it could be “indirectly standardized” by using the age structure prevailing in\nFlorida, and comparing Florida’s actual mortality rate to the one that would have been\nexpected had the overall US age-specific mortality schedule been applied to its actual\npopulation.18 These two approaches, however, will lead to different numerical values,\nand even different rankings among countries and population groups, when the survival\ncurves of the two countries being compared cross each other. In these circumstances,\nboth types of standardization should be used.\n• Median life expectancy is sometimes useful and behaves very differently from mean\nlife expectancy. Age-specific mortality curves are high in the first years of life\n(especially in poor countries), dip to a minimum and then rise slowly from about age 30.\nAs a result, reductions in infant mortality, by reducing the mortality peak at low ages,\nsharply reduce interpersonal inequality in years of life lived, with implications for some\nof the measures of health inequalities that are discussed below. In the highest mortality\ncountries – Mali in 1960, for example – median life expectancy at birth was around 5\nyears, though mean life expectancy was around 37 years. The use of median life\nexpectancy has other implications. For example, as child and infant mortality falls, the\nmedian age of death suddenly jumps from young to old; as soon as that happens, median\nlife expectancy exceeds mean life expectancy while, after that, the mean will typically\nrise faster than the median if mortality continues to fall. These properties of median life\nexpectancy point to the complexity of reducing the age-specific mortality structure to a\nsingle measure of population health, given its typical properties, and to the problems\nposed by using standard measures of life expectancy when comparing countries with\ndifferences balances between child and old-age mortality.\nThe different properties of these various measures used to summarize the information\nprovided by the vector of age- and gender-specific mortality rates stress the importance of\nusing a set of these synthetic measures for assessing mortality.\nMorbidity\nMeasures of morbidity, or non-fatal health conditions, are even more varied than for\nmortality. These measures are relevant measures of the functioning of people who are alive\nand, as such, they can be used at the individual level, not just for populations. In other words,\nwe can talk about the distribution of morbidity across people in a way that is hard to do for\nlife expectancy. While some scholars argue that population morbidity moves in parallel with\npopulation mortality, there is no guarantee that it must always do so, and there have been\ntimes when it did not. For example, Riley (1997) argued that the decline of mortality in\nBritain in the XIXth century was accompanied by large increases in morbidity, at least\ninitially; in his terms, British working men were “sick, not dead”. In some circumstances, the\nrelation between mortality and morbidity can vary across countries and the population\ncovered. For example, a recent review of trends in severe disability among the elderly in 12\nOECD countries found evidence of a decline in Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and\nthe United States; of an increase in Belgium, Japan and Sweden; of stability in Australia,\n18.\nThese two measures are closely analogous to Laspeyres and Paasche price indices.\n\n160\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nCanada; and of changes in different directions, depending on the source used, in France and\nthe United Kingdom (Lafortune et al., 2007). \nThe available indicators of morbidity are based on either administrative and register data,\nor on self-reports by people. The available metrics, however, remain limited in important\nways, and they often provide an inadequate basis for benchmarking morbidity across\ncountries and for assessing its evolution over time. Some of the most familiar measures of\nmorbidity include the following: \n• Anthropometric measures. These measures are especially useful for children. Height\nand weight allow calculating measures of stunting (long-run nutritional deprivation) and\nwasting (short-run nutritional deprivation), which are central data in health\nmeasurement in poor countries. Adult height is strongly affected by nutrition and\ndisease in the first three years of life, and it does not change (much) in adulthood. As a\nresult, even a single cross-section of adults classified by height can tell a great deal\nabout the childhood nutritional and health history of the current population. Adult\nheight provides a measure of the combined effects of disease and income during\nchildhood: taller people earn more and are better educated and more satisfied with their\nlives than shorter people; they also experience more enjoyment and happiness, less pain\nand depression, and lower blood-pressure, cholesterol and mortality. These individual\neffects, however, can only be observed in large samples. Both height and weight data\nare needed to compute measures of obesity (using the body-mass index, BMI), which is\nbecoming a public health issue in most OECD countries.\n• Disease-specific information. Information on the prevalence of different diseases can\nbe based on disease registries, registries of general practitioners, hospital discharge data,\npharmaceutical databases, and health interview surveys. The information collected is\nusually focused on a shortlist of diseases, typically selected among those that contribute\nthe most to the burden of disease in different countries. Health interviews often include\nquestions of the form: “has a doctor ever told you that you have X”, followed by a\nshortlist of diseases. The advantage of this type of question is that it seeks information\non diseases that have been diagnosed by a health professional, as opposed to relying on\na purely subjective assessment; the drawback is that responses will be affected by the\nextent to which people have access to medical doctors. Some population-based surveys\nalso collect information on biomarkers, including blood pressure and anaemia.\nInformation from these surveys has allowed important (and surprising) comparisons of\nhealth status across nations. For example, Banks et al. (2006) conclude that the US\npopulation in late middle age are less healthy than their British counterparts with respect\nto diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, lung disease and\ncancer. This conclusion applies when relying on biological markers of various diseases,\nand holds true even after controlling for a standard set of behavioural risk-factors (e.g.\nsmoking, overweight, obesity, and alcohol consumption). Surveys are increasingly\nbeing put in place in Europe and the United States (as well as India and China) that\nwould support such comparisons, particularly among people over age 50.\n• General measures of self-reported health. A commonly-asked question in national\nhealth surveys is of the type: “How is your health in general?” Responses to this type of\nquestion can be collected easily and quickly in surveys, and they predict subsequent\nmortality even after controls for a physical examination by medical personnel. They are\nrelated to a wide range of diseases and conditions in a cross-section of the population,\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n161\nand they decline with people’s age, though perhaps not as much as expected. Data on\nself-reported general health highlight other interesting features. For example, women\nhave worse self-reported health status than men, though they live longer. This is not\nnecessarily a flaw in the measure, as women may get sick while men get dead, so\nrankings of mortality and morbidity would differ (Case and Paxson, 2005). A more\nserious problem is that mean self-reported health status has been stable over time, in\nspite of large reductions in mortality. This suggests that these measures of self-reported\ngeneral health may be subject to the sort of adaptation that would make them unsuitable\nas an objective measure of morbidity. A critical problem for the international\ncomparability of these measures is the cultural bias that arises when answering these\nquestions, as well as the use of different scales across countries: while self-reported\nhealth is usually reported on a “Likert scale” of 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor), there are\nexceptions (e.g. Japan).19\n• Vignettes have recently been proposed to try to remove any systematic biases in self-\nreported answers to questions on general health status. In this approach, respondents are\nasked to rate a standard scenario concerning someone whose health status is described,\nwith these reports then used to standardize the self-reported measures of health status.\nThe extent to which the use of vignettes solves the underlying problem of the non-\ncomparability of individual answers is still unsettled. Another approach to correcting\npossible biases in self-reported information is to carry out tests of people’s ability to see,\nhear, walk, think and remember. Such tests are, however, costly, as they involve face-to-\nface encounters and long interviews and examinations.\n• Specific measures of self-reported health. Several national health surveys also include\nmore specific questions on key dimensions of health status. These questions often relate\nto limitations in the ability to see, hear, walk, grasp objects, think and remember. These\nsurveys may also include questions about pain and mood. An important issue for cross-\ncountry comparisons is the lack of standardization of survey questions and response\ncategories. However, some initiatives have been recently undertaken to develop a small\nset of harmonized measures of health status in national surveys.20 A further issue for\nthese measures relates to cultural biases that might affect the comparability of responses\nacross countries. \n• Activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Health surveys also\ncollect data on the ability of people to perform various activities of daily living (ADLs)\nor instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).21 These are direct measures of\nfunctionings in various dimensions, and they appear to correspond well to actual\n19.\nFor example, in European countries the response scale is usually “symmetric”, with response categories\nranging from “very good, good, fair, poor, very poor”; conversely, in non-European countries response categories\nare often “asymmetric” (i.e. “excellent, very good, good, fair, poor”). The wording of questions also matters. For\nexample, World Values Survey questions ask about “satisfaction with health” (on a 0 to 5 scale) rather than about\n“self-reported health”; based on this question, satisfaction with health declines steadily with age. However, when\nCanadian respondents to another survey were asked to rate their health satisfaction relative to other people of the\nsame age, this downward trend disappears. This suggests that measures of health satisfaction are less likely to\nreflect health conditions than are subjective assessments of health status (Helliwell, 2008)\n20.\nOne recent example is the Budapest Initiative on Health Status Measures http://www.unece.org/stats/\ndocuments/ece/ces/2007/6.e.pdf.\n\n162\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nfunctionings. They do not suffer from the problem that the poor say they are less sick\nthan the rich, in circumstances where other evidence suggests that this is far from the\ncase. A drawback is that they are useful only for older people, since almost all young\npeople can perform all of these activities. \nMeasurement challenges are also high when moving beyond physical health to include\nvarious forms of mental disorders. Most research based on this subject reports high\nprevalence of mental disorders, For example, data from the WHO World Mental Health\nSurvey Initiative show that the share of people who have experienced some type of mental\nhealth disorder (i.e. anxiety disorders, mood disorders, disorders linked to impulse control or\nthe use of alcohol or drugs) in the previous year ranged from 9% in Italy, Japan, Spain and\nGermany, to 18% in France and 26% in the United States, with much higher levels when\nlooking at life-time prevalence (close to 40% in France and 50% in the United States, Kessler\net al., 2007). Most of these cases are classified as “mild” or “moderate”, and most of them go\nuntreated. In European countries, people who are young, female, unemployed, disabled and\nunmarried have higher risks of mental disorders (Alonso et al., 2004). It is more difficult to\nassess whether the prevalence of mental disorders is rising, with various studies arriving at\ndifferent conclusions22. More research on mental health – based on national representative\nsamples, common diagnostic questions, and surveys repeated at regular intervals – is clearly\nneeded, and governments should assist by undertaking more systematic surveys.\nCombined health measures\nThe various dimensions of people’s health status have led, in recent years, to the\ndevelopment of a variety of measures that try to combine mortality and morbidity into a\nsingle measure of health status. All of these measures aim to calculate the average number of\nyears of life spent in good health, after adjusting for years lived with some form of illness or\ndisability. Examples include the following:\n• Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is typically disease-specific: the burden of each\ndisease in the population is obtained by adding the number of years of life lost through\ndeath and the number of “equivalent” years lost to disability. The equivalence is based\non a set of weights for a long list of medical conditions (e.g. a year with an untreated\nfractured skull to someone aged 45-59 is valued as equivalent to 42% of a healthy year,\nan amputated foot loses 30%, and schizophrenia loses 57%). There are, however,\nongoing debates about the best method to elicit the valuation of different health states.23\n21.\nActivities of daily living are the things normally done in a typical day, such as bathing, dressing, eating,\nwalking, using toilets and moving from a bed to a chair. Instrumental activities of daily living are not necessary for\nfundamental functioning but enable the individual to live independently within a community: they include items\nsuch as preparing meals, taking medicines, using a telephone, shopping, managing money and performing light\nhousework. \n22.\nFor example, Weissmann et al. (1992), based on a study of major depression in a large number of countries,\nconclude that “more recent birth cohorts are at increased risk of major depression”. Similarly, studies based on\ndata over long periods of time report a rising prevalence of mental disorders in the Netherlands (Hoidiamont et al.,\n2005; Verhaak et al. , 2005), Belgium (Wautericks and Bracke, 2005) and the United Kingdom (Sacker and\nWiggins, 2002; Oswald and Powdhavee, 2007) but stability in the United States (Murphy et al., 2000; Kessler et\nal., 2005).\n23.\nThese measured were originally developed for the World Bank’s 1993 World Development Report.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n163\n• Disability-Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) quantifies the remaining years a person of a\ncertain age can expect to live without disability. Its computation requires mortality data\nfrom standard life tables, and estimates of the prevalence of disability among population\ngroups, usually self-reported measures of general health based on a simple dichotomous\nvariable (with a value of 0 if people report being moderately or severely disabled, or 1 if\nthey report not being disabled).24 \n• Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE) measures the number of years that an\nindividual can expect to live in full health if current morbidity and mortality conditions\nprevail. It adjusts life expectancy by giving a larger weight to the years of life lived in\ngood health compared to the years lived in poor health. The measures of health status\nusually come from questions on key dimensions of physical and mental functioning\ndrawn from health surveys. The weighting of years of life depends on the valuation of\ndifferent combinations of health status, with values ranging from 0 (in the case of death)\nto 1 (in the case of full health).25 \nRegular monitoring of summary measures of population health across large numbers of\ncountries is still uncommon. These measures are easy to interpret, as they are based on\nrecognizable concepts of illness, disability and mortality, but their calculation is complex,\nsince they rely on different data sources — e.g. a measure of morbidity or disability, usually\nfrom a health or household survey, and a measure of mortality, often from a census cohort\nlinked to a mortality registry. More fundamentally, however, their construction raises a\nnumber of ethical problems: for example, DALYs value a disabled life at less than a life\nwithout disability (Anand and Hanson, 1997)26; this implies that these measures, if used to\ndesign health-care delivery, would implicitly disfavour the treatment of people with\ndisabilities. Similarly, the legitimacy of the weights used in the construction of these\ncombined measures is not always clear; for example, one of the major “findings” of the global\nburden of disease studies — the heavy burden of mental illness — may owe as much to\nassumptions as to measurement.27 In spite of these problems, combined health measures\nrespond to a genuine need, and the drive to develop them is expected to continue. Both\nEurostat and the World Health Organization have recently intensified their efforts to reach a\nconsensus on which indicator to use, and to harmonize underlying data sources and methods\nfor their construction. In any case, however, “combined health measures” should be\nconceived as part of a coherent system of health statistics, which should include the capacity\nto analyze developments for individuals and population groups.\n24.\nDFLE has achieved some currency since being officially adopted by the EU as one of the European\nStructural Indicators. In the United States, an indicator of life expectancy free of activity limitation (an equivalent\nconcept to DFLE) is one of several summary measures of population health monitored under the US Healthy\nPeople 2010 Initiative.\n25.\nEstimates of HALE have been produced and are being regularly updated in some countries (e.g. Canada).\nWHO has also reported estimates of HALE for all countries in its 2004 World Health Report.\n26.\nThis problem is alleviated when some priority for the worse-off is introduced in the evaluation. If the\ndisabled are among the worse-off, it is more worthwhile to expand their life expectancies even if this does not add\nmuch to their total health as measured by such indices.\n27.\nAn alternative to this type of “macro level” aggregation is provided by two-steps aggregation methods that,\nfirst, generate some summary health score for each person, and then aggregate these individual level summary\nscores to the population level (Wolfson, 1999). This individual-level aggregation is the analogue, in the health\nsphere, of the methods based on “aggregating indicators for each individual” discussed later in this chapter in the\nsection dealing with aggregation among QoL dimensions.\n\n164\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nHealth inequalities\nThe variety of existing health measures raises challenges not just for cross-country\ncomparisons of average health status but also for within-county inequalities. Analyzing the\nsize and determinants of these inequalities in health status has become a growing focus of\nepidemiological research in recent year. While some of these studies are based on simple\nmeasures of dispersion in the age of death – or, alternatively, in the length of life – among\nindividuals in different countries (Edwards and Tuljapurkar, 2005)28, these measures of\ndispersion cannot be used to classify people currently living, and they lack cogency. For\nexample, differences in the life span of people may reflect genetic differences that are\nrandomly distributed in the population: in these circumstances, narrowing the overall\ndistribution of life duration would not make society less “unequal” in any morally compelling\nway.\nMost of the research on health inequalities has looked at between-group differences in\neither mortality or morbidity, highlighting a number of consistent patterns. People from lower\noccupational classes who have less education and income tend to die at younger ages and to\nsuffer a higher prevalence of various health problems within their shorter lifetimes\n(Mackenback, 2006). Further, these differences in health conditions do not merely reflect\nworse outcomes for people at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder but extend to\npeople throughout the socio-economic hierarchy: for example, life expectancy in the United\nKingdom increases when moving from unskilled manual workers to skilled ones, from\nmanual to non-manual workers, and from lower-ranked office workers to higher-ranked staff\n(ONS, 2006). In European countries, the mortality rates of less-educated people are, on\naverage, around 50% higher than for their more-educated counterparts, with lower gaps for\nwomen compared to men, and for the elderly compared to younger people (Mackenback,\n2006). Further, these inter-group health inequalities do not consistently narrow over time, and\nare even widening in some countries. Inequalities in average life expectancy are also\nsignificant between ethnic groups. \nWhile these patterns have an obvious relevance for assessing QoL in various countries,\nsystematic data collection in this field remains sparse. It is not possible, for example, to\ncompare the size of these health inequalities across countries in the same way as is\nconventionally done for income (and education). This reflects differences across studies in the\nmeasures of health outcomes used, in the individual characteristics considered (education,\nincome, ethnicity), and in the reference population and geographic coverage of the various\nstudies. Improvements in the measurement of health inequalities (in both absolute and relative\nterms), and especially the linkage between health outcomes and socio-economic status,\nshould be recognized as a priority for statistical work in the years to come.\n \n28.\nThese measures highlight some significant differences across countries and over time. For example, the\nstandard deviation in the age of death above 10 (a measure that abstracts from the decline in child mortality that\naffected all OECD countries) was highest in 2003 in the United States and France, and lowest in the Netherlands\nand Sweden. Japan, which started from a level close to that of the United States in 1960, recorded large declines\nuntil the early 1990s, and increases since then; Denmark, which started from low levels close to those of Sweden,\nrecorded strong rises until 1990 and declines thereafter.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n165\nEducation\nA long tradition of economic research has recognized the skills and talents embodied in\nthe population as a critical input into economic production. This human capital is created by\ninvesting in education and training, combined with parental inputs (e.g. supervision and\nmentoring) and societal resources (e.g. libraries, museums, etc). Approaches to the\nmeasurement of human capital based on frameworks similar to those used for economic\naccounting (described in Annex 1 of Chapter 3 of this report) figure prominently in research\non non-market accounts (Abraham and Mackie, 2005). \nWhat is recognized less often is that education, literacy, reasoning and learning are also\nimportant for QoL. They are important in their own right, as better cognitive functioning\nexpands individuals’ freedoms and opportunities, independently of any effect that it may have\non people’s earnings or on countries’ economic activity. Indeed, as argued by Adam Smith,\nthe father of human capital theory, the role of education and skills acquisition for the quality\nof life is distinct from its contribution to economic output. This implies that the neglect of\neducation for a boy who is put to work at an early age has important non-economic\nconsequences: “When he is grown up he has no ideas with which he can amuse himself.”\nSmith also noted that the lack of education deprives people from participating in religious\nactivities and can lead to “riot and debauchery” (Lectures on Jurisprudence).\nBroader impact of education on QoL\nBeyond its intrinsic value, education is also instrumental in achieving a variety of\noutcomes that matter for QoL. Some of these outcomes are monetary and accrue to the person\nmaking this investment (i.e. higher earnings, income and wealth). But others are non-\nmonetary, and they benefit both the individual and society at large. Evidence indicates that\nindividuals who attended school for longer, or who achieved higher educational\nqualifications, are more likely to report greater subjective well-being, to participate more\nactively in society and to enjoy better health. While the available research does not always\nallow determining whether the relation between education and these other dimensions of QoL\nis “causal” (rather than reflecting the importance of some other factor bearing on both\neducation and other outcomes), the existence of an educational “gradient” (i.e. higher\neducation contributes to various features of a good life) is in itself an important finding that\nwarrants attention. \nThe available evidence on the broader effects of education relates to a number of QoL\ndimensions:29\n• Subjective well-being. People with a tertiary education report higher evaluations of their\nlives as whole, and this effect holds even after controlling for income (Helliwell, 2008).\nEvidence on the causal effect of education on subjective well-being is provided by\nresearch on the effects of higher compulsory schooling in the United States, Great\nBritain and Ireland, which suggests that students who take an extra year of schooling\nexperience higher subjective well-being; these effects are robust to a wide array of\nspecification checks (Oreopoulos, 2007). \n29.\nThis evidence is analyzed in OECD (2007) and in follow-up work at the OECD Centre for Educational\nResearch and Innovation. \n\n166\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n• Health. There is compelling evidence of a correlation between education and health. In\nEuropean countries, the mortality rates of less-educated men are, on average, 50%\nhigher than those of more-educated men, while the difference is 30% for women\n(Mackenbach, 2006). The relation between education and health holds both for serious\nhealth problems, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, and for more common\nillnesses, such as colds, headaches and aches and pains from other causes (Stone et al.,\n2008). Evidence on the “causal” nature of these effects (i.e. whether education causes\nhealth effects, or vice versa, or the existence of some other factors that shape the\nrelation between the two) is sparser, and varies with the health dimension considered.\nFor example, most evidence suggests that schooling reduces both the likelihood of\nsmoking and the number of cigarettes smoked (see De Walque, 2007 and Grimard and\nParent, 2007; see also Fuchs and Farrell, 1982 for an earlier analysis reaching an\nopposite conclusion), while the evidence is mixed when considering effects on alcohol\nconsumption and obesity.30 Education also influences access to health care, at least for\nsome categories of services (e.g. specialist and dental care, van Doorslaer et al., 2004),\nalthough these inequalities in access are believed to offer only an incomplete\nexplanation of the observed gradient in health status. Overall, the consensus seems to be\nthat the effects of education on health are positive and causal (Grossman, 2008; Cutler\net al., 2008). Groot and Maasen van den Brink (2007) calculate the value of these health\nimprovements due to education as equivalent to between 15% and 60% of the financial\nreturns to education. \n• Civic and Social Engagement refers to the broad range of behaviours that influence\npeople’s participation in political and social activities, as well as their attitudes with\nrespect to trust and tolerance of others. In all OECD countries, better-educated people\nare more likely to vote, although, across countries, voting turnout has declined despite\nhigher educational attainment. The evidence on the effect of education on political\nengagement is mixed, with evidence of a causal effect in the United States (Milligan et\nal, 2004; Dee, 2004), but not in Europe (Milligan et al,, 2004; Siedler, 2007; Touya,\n2006). Conversely, evidence based on changes in compulsory schooling and child\nlabour laws suggests that education does not have an impact on volunteering rates,\nparticipation in groups, interpersonal trust and tolerance (Dee, 2004).\nIndicators\nSeveral indicators allow describing the state of education. Some of these indicators refer to\ninputs (e.g. school enrolment, educational expenditures and school resources), while others\nrefer to throughputs and outputs (e.g. graduation rates, expected number of completed years\nof schooling, standardized test measures of student and adult achievement in terms of literacy\nand numeracy). Which of these indicators is more relevant depends on a country’s stage of\ndevelopment and on the goal of the evaluation exercise.31 For example, indicators of\n30.\nArendt (2005) and Spasojevic (2003) use reform of the minimum school-leaving age to identify the effect of\neducation on BMI in Denmark and Sweden: in both countries the change lowered the probability of being over-\nweight, but not significantly in the case of Denmark. Kenkel et al. (2006), using changes in high-school graduation\nlaws in the United States, do not find any significant difference in the BMI of high-school drop-outs and high-\nschool graduates. Lundborg (2008), based on data referring to monozygotic (identical) twins in the United States,\nreports that less-educated twins report lower self-reported heath and worse chronic conditions, but no difference in\nhealth behaviours, including BMI.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n167\nenrolment in elementary and secondary school are less informative in countries where the\nvast majority of students graduate from secondary school; similarly, some countries may\ncombine widespread basic education for all with limited opportunities for higher education\n(e.g. China), while others may have a more developed system of higher education alongside\nwidespread illiteracy (e.g. India). Finally, indicators of school enrolment inform about access\nto education, but they may provide a misleading picture of outcomes if schools do not provide\neffective instruction. \nAll these indicators, beyond informing about the average conditions in each country, can\nalso provide important information about disparities in the distribution of educational\nopportunities. For example, if girls are afforded fewer educational opportunities than boys, or\nif ethnic or racial minorities are forced to attend separate (or lower-quality) schools, or are\nexcluded from education altogether, then society as a whole may be worse-off. These\nconcerns about inequality have become more important in the policy agendas of several\ncountries. In the United States, for example, concerns in recent years about the lower\neducational opportunities for low-income and minority students have motivated the\nprovisions of the No Child Left Behind Act. Educational disparities can be measured in many\ndifferent ways, such as by comparing indicators across groups with differences in\ndemographic features, parental income or education or across regions with different\ncharacteristics, or by computing a measure of the dispersion in the distribution of the\neducational measure of interest. All of these inequalities are simply lost by indicators that\naggregate people’s diverse experiences into an average measure of school performance or\neducational achievement.\nSome of the most relevant indicators for assessing the role of education for QoL are\nmeasures of people’s competencies (i.e. direct measures of what people have learned\nin various settings). Several tools have been developed in recent years to provide\nstandardized measures of these competencies, such as:\n• The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which has been\nconducted in three waves, covering 43 countries in 2000, 41 countries in 2003 and 58\ncountries in 2006, with a new wave now in the field. This survey covers 15-year-old\nstudents with tests focusing on reading, mathematics, and science.\n• The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), which has now\nbeen conducted in four waves (1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007). This survey was developed\nby the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA),\nand covers 4th and 8th graders, with a focus on mathematics and science\n• The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), also developed by the\nIEA. This survey covers 4th graders, and focuses on reading literacy.\n31.\nEducation – as measured by adult literacy and by the combined enrolment rates for primary, secondary and\ntertiary education – is included in the Human Development Index. The particular weighting of the components of\neducation in the HDI (two-thirds for literacy, one-third for enrolment rates) is somewhat arbitrary. These\neducational indicators have little discriminatory power among developed countries.\n\n168\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n• The International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), which tested adults in prose,\nunderstanding of documents and quantitative skills. This survey was conducted in\nvarious years from 1995 to 1998, covering 22 countries and regions around the world.\n• The Adult Literacy and Life Skills survey (ALL), which tested people aged 16-65 in the\nfields of prose and document literacy, numeracy, as well as reasoning and analytical\nproblem-solving, in two waves (2002 and 2006) covering twelve countries (or regions\nthereof). \nTo a large extent, the origins of these large-scale comparative testing programmes lie in the\nexperiences pursued in the United States and Canada in the 1980s and early 1990s on the\nlarge-scale assessment of people and adults. The data collected as part of these international\ncomparison programmes tend to be more comparable across countries than data on school\nenrolment or educational attainment. Indeed, even within the United States, there are\nsignificant differences in the way in which different states calculate high-school graduation\nrates, which significantly limit comparability. These test data have highlighted large\ndifferences in average test scores across countries,32 as well as large inequalities in\nachievement among students. Inequalities in science scores are described in Figure 2.2 in\nterms of the share of students with insufficient levels of achievement (level 1 or 0), and the\ndifferences in scores between students from households with different socio-economic\ncharacteristics. \n32.\nFor example, PISA test scores in mathematics in 2006 in the United States and France were, respectively,\n14% and 10% lower than in the country topping the OECD league (Finland). \nFigure 2.2. Inequalities in science literacy scores of 15-year-old students in 2006\nSource: OECD Programme for International Student Assessment, 2006.\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nShare of students with insufficient achievements\nInequality is students achievements by households socio‐economic status\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n169\nDespite this variety of surveys, existing measures of competencies remain limited in\nimportant ways. Beyond their limited geographical coverage, some of these tools were\ndeveloped for the purpose of assessing educational policies, which required focusing on a\nmore narrow set of measurable competencies than those that are potentially relevant for\nmeasuring people’s capabilities. Even for literacy surveys that have a broader focus than\nschools per se, it has not always proved possible to construct measures of sufficient reliability\nfor a number of competencies (such as teamwork, practical cognition and use of information\nand communication technologies), and for which assessment would disproportionately\nincrease the response burden and require the use of different tools than self-completed\ninstruments. Despite these limits, some of the surveys developed in recent years have moved\nbeyond a perspective focused on a narrow set of specific competencies, and this trend is\nexpected to accelerate with the development of the OECD Programme for International\nAssessment of Adult Competencies (Box 2.3).33  More generally, a QoL perspective on\neducation would suggest the importance of looking beyond excellence in specific\ncompetencies, to include openness to other cultures, a capacity for self-expression and\nreasoned discussion, tolerance for other people's views, and the enjoyment that students\nderive from classrooms.\nBox 2.3. The OECD Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies\nThe Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) aims to: i) identify\nand measure differences between individuals and countries in competencies believed to underlie both\npersonal and societal success; ii) assess the impact of these competencies on social and economic\noutcomes at individual and aggregate levels; iii) gauge the performance of education and training systems\nin generating required competencies; and iv) help to clarify the policy levers that could contribute to\nenhancing competencies.\nTo meet these goals, a questionnaire will aim to measure the interest, attitude and ability of individuals\nto appropriately use socio-cultural tools, including digital technology and communications tools; to access,\nmanage, integrate and evaluate information and construct new knowledge; and to communicate with\nothers. PIACC will assess adult competencies in the fields of literacy (both prose and documents), reading,\nnumeracy and problem-solving. In addition, PIAAC will collect information from respondents concerning\ntheir use of key work-skills in their job (building on the experience of the UK Skills Survey) as well as\ncomprehensive background information (e.g. educational attainment, family and linguistic background,\nlabour-market status, income, health status, civic participation, literacy and numeracy practices at home\nand at work, as well as participation in education and training and familiarity with ICT tools). By\nproviding a direct measure of key cognitive skills, PIAAC will give a picture of the distribution of the\npopulation’s proficiency according to the types and levels of cognitive tasks that they can perform together\nwith the levels of formal education and training achieved. PIAAC will also allow describing changes over\ntime in some of these competencies, by linking to previous international adult skills assessments.\nPIAAC will be a multi-cycle programme that covers a range of policy concerns over time. The\nadministration of the survey will take place in 2011, with the results to be released in early 2013; a field\ntrial is foreseen in 2010 with development work occurring over the period 2008-2009. As of December\n2009, 29 countries planned to participate in PIACC.\nSource: Thorn (2009).\n33.\nPISA: for example, defines reading literacy as the ability of students to use written information in situations\nwhich they encounter in their life: this implies a capacity to understand, use and reflect on written texts in order to\nachieve one’s goals, to develop one’s knowledge and potential, and to participate in society. This definition goes\nbeyond the traditional notion of decoding information and giving a literal interpretation of what is written and is\noriented towards more applied tasks. Reading literacy used in PISA is defined by the format of the reading\nmaterial, the type of reading task or aspects, and the situation or use for which the text was constructed.\n\n170\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nA second limit relates to the coverage of existing assessment tools. Schooling is only one\nof the inputs that lead to individual knowledge, skills development and improvements in QoL.\nThe importance of out-of-school educational experiences is well documented but often\nignored in empirical studies, because of data limitations. For example, while some tools allow\nassessing the non-cognitive aspects of child development (e.g. motor coordination, social\ninteractions), few large-scale surveys focus on young children (e.g. their caring arrangements,\nthe time spent in them, the structure of these arrangements and the soft competencies that are\ndeveloped) – despite growing evidence that what is learned in early childhood has significant\nimpacts on later learning outcomes. Similarly, measurement tools remain inadequate to assess\nthe participation and competencies learned in adult education and training, and how these\nprogrammes benefit people with different characteristics. \nMore generally, however, the main problem for indicators in this domain is not the lack of\nmore detailed information on education per se, but rather the lack of surveys providing\nmeasures of both education and other outcomes that matter for quality of life at the individual\nlevel. The availability of such surveys, designed in a way that allows comparisons across\ncountries, would permit a better understanding of the relationship between education and\nother dimensions of QoL, including the pathways through which education operates and what\neducators and policy makers can do to enhance the role of education in promoting QoL. The\ndesign of effective educational policies and programmes that could have beneficial spill-over\neffects on other dimensions of QoL crucially depends on knowing what works and what does\nnot, what we could change and what we could do better.\nPersonal activities\nWhy do they matter for quality of life?\nPersonal activities matter for QoL in a many ways. First, and most obvious, the activities\nthat people engage in have predictable effects on both their hedonic experiences and their\nevaluative judgements. As an example, Figure 2.3 shows the ranking of various daily\nactivities for a sample of women in two cities in the United States and France who report on\nhow they spend their time on a typical day and on the enjoyment they derive from them. In\nboth countries, making love, exercising and playing are the most enjoyable activities, while\ncommuting and (paid) work are the least enjoyable ones; despite some differences between\nthe two countries, these ranking are remarkably consistent. The main activity of each person,\nsuch as having a good job or being unemployed, also maps consistently into people’s life-\nevaluations. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n171\nMore generally, it cannot be assumed that people choose among these various activities in\nthe same way as they allocate their budget among various goods and services, as they may\nhave little say in them (e.g. poor families who may prefer to send their kids to work rather\nthan school). Choices over various personal activities can also have externalities on other\nfamily members (as in the case of choices about work and leisure) and on people living in the\nsame community (as in the case of commuting). Moreover, the capability approach underlies\nthe intrinsic value of some of these personal activities and their contributions to QoL.\nOne pressing question is to identify the most important personal activities that affect QoL.\nThose retained below are paid work, commuting, unpaid work and leisure time. As many of\nthese activities are performed at home, and as this home setting is an important determinant of\nthe quality of non-working life, measures of “housing” are also discussed here. While this list\nof personal activities is partial, it reflects political demands and the feasibility of providing\nconcrete and comparable measures. Several objective indicators can be used to measure these\npersonal activities and the balance between them at different periods of people’s lives (such as\nthe balance between paid work and family life for women with young children). These\nFigure 2.3.

For all personal activities, time-use surveys (TUS) provide a crude\nbut essential quantitative indicator of how people spend their time in various tasks. These\nsurveys also provide essential information from the perspective of integrating non-market\nwork into conventional economic accounts. However, such surveys remain one of the less-\ndeveloped areas in the statistical system of most countries: they are undertaken only\noccasionally (if at all), based on protocols that differ significantly across countries, and they\nlack uniform international standards. Because of their roles in providing direct measures of\nhow people spend their time, such surveys should be undertaken more regularly and be based\non frameworks that allow valid cross-country and inter-temporal comparisons.\nPaid work\nPaid work contributes to QoL both positively and negatively. Paid work provides income\nas well as identity and social interactions, but it may also be a source of negative experiences\nand risks. Most prime-aged people in OECD countries have a paid job today, but only a\nsmaller proportion hold jobs that match their inclinations and skills and that provide\nopportunities for development. While all dimensions are missed by simple employment\ncounts, several national and international organizations provide information on qualitative\naspects of paid work. Among these, some of the most relevant for any assessment of QoL are\nthe indicators developed by the International Labour Office (ILO) in various studies\ndedicated to the concept of “decent work”. Decent work is an essential determinant of QoL,\nand ILO tries to promote this concept in all the world’s countries.\nDecent work is a multidimensional concept, which includes all the elements listed in\nBox 2.4. These elements, which also contribute to the economic and social security of\nworkers and their families, include the balance between paid work and other activities (as in\nthe case of “combining work and family life”) and a dimension of social dialogue (i.e. the\ncollective conditions that shape the QoL and well-being of workers in the workplace). Also,\ndecent work refers to rights, whether or not they exist yet (i.e. are internationally recognized)\nor have been institutionalized.\nBox 2.4.

Beyond the various\nreports and data collections undertaken by the ILO, the European Foundation for the\nImprovement of Living and Working Conditions (Dublin Foundation) conducts surveys every\nfive years on working conditions in the EU and accession countries.34 These surveys (whose\npractical use is, however, limited by the small sample size for each country) provide data on\nmany aspects of decent work, such as non-standard employment, gender gaps in employment\nand wages, discrimination in the workplace, lifelong learning and training, employment of\ndisabled persons, working time and “unsocial hours”, perceived work-life balance, work\naccidents and physical risk factors, work intensity, work-related health problems, social\ndialogue and workers’ autonomy. National surveys of working conditions also exist in several\ncountries. These should be extended to other countries in the world, based on a consistent\ndesign, so as to allow measuring both less-tangible aspects of paid work and the diversity of\nexperiences across workers.\nEach of these aspects of “decent work” needs to be measured with several potential\nindicators. While not everything can be included, the Commission recommends retaining a\nlimited number of key indicators linked to the concept of decent work, to be selected in\nconsultation with relevant stakeholders and international agencies. These indicators should be\nadapted to both developed and developing countries, and highlight the gender division of\ntasks and risks in special sectors such as agriculture. Some jobs carry greater health\nconsequences than others: for example, transplanting during rice cultivation implies exposure\nto water-borne diseases and to chemicals, and women – who do most of this work – retain\ntoxic chemicals for longer. Measures of “decent work” should also be developed at the sub-\nnational and regional level.\nThe measurement difficulties in this field are well illustrated by workplace accidents,\nwhich represent the most visible manifestation of the hazards of paid work. Work accidents\nare sudden and sometimes violent events that occur during the execution of work and lead to\nhealth damage or loss of life for the worker involved. International comparisons of work\naccidents are difficult because of differences both in record-keeping – e.g. statistics\nsometimes only record “compensated” accidents in workplaces of a sufficient size and\nexclude minor injuries – and in data-sources – insurance companies, social security registers,\nlabour inspectorates, establishment censuses and special surveys. Moreover, firms may under-\nreport work accidents in countries where the social contributions that they pay depend on the\nfrequency of accidents. Comparability has improved since the adoption in 1998 of an ILO\nResolution on “Statistics on occupational injuries resulting from accidents at work”, which\nsets out standards for data collection and presentation, but problems remain. For example, the\nreporting of non-fatal injuries is limited to injuries causing absences from work of more than\nthree days in European countries and Japan, of six or more days in Australia, and of one or\nmore days in other countries. In all countries, available statistics exclude absences that cause\nlower working hours rather than an outright absence from the workplace.35 Changes in the\n34.\nSee, for example, the Annual Review of Working Conditions in the EU 2007–2008; the Fourth European\nWorking Conditions Survey, 2007; and the First European Quality of Life Survey: Time Use and Work–Life\nOptions over the Life Course, 2007.\n35.\nIn 2003, fatal work accidents were most frequent in Turkey, Korea and Mexico and least frequent in the\nUnited Kingdom and Sweden; their frequency has declined since 1995. Non-fatal accidents are more common, and\nthey have also declined in most OECD countries (OECD, 2006a).\n\n174\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nfrequency of reported accidents from administrative and insurance sources might also reflect\nchanges in insurance rules that alter employers’ incentives to under-report minor accidents or\nto offer reduced work hours to injured employees. All these differences in reporting practices\nlimit statistical comparability in this field.\nBecause of its multidimensional nature, several attempts have aimed at constructing\ncomposite indices of decent work. Figure 2.4 provides an example that shows a country\nranking among the 25 countries with the best rank, as published in International Labour\nReview (2003). This composite index is based on seven sub-indicators (themselves\ncomposite), whose choice was partly determined by data availability: i) security of the labour\nmarket (various indicators of the availability of jobs); ii) employment security (the opposite\nof precariousness); iii) professional or skills security (availability of skilled jobs); iv) security\nat work (working conditions, including hours worked); v) security linked to education and\ntraining; vi) income security; and vii) workers’ voice. Ways of conveying information on\ncomplex, multidimensional concepts such as decent work through composite measures should\nbe more systematically explored.\nUnpaid domestic work\nMost of the existing indicators used to inform about QoL neglect issues related to unpaid\ndomestic work, such as shopping, family chores, and care of children and other dependent\nmembers of the household. This is an important omission. As for other personal activities, a\ndirect measure of the quantity of time devoted to these domestic chores could be compiled\nbased on time-use surveys. Such data, in turn, would allow computing measures of the\ninequality between men and women in the distribution of these unpaid domestic activities.\nThese data would also allow better comparisons over time and across countries, and shed\nlights on many other inequalities (for example, in terms of employment and leisure). \nIn principle, indicators should also allow assessing the quality of unpaid domestic labour,\nalthough few objective criteria exist in this field. However, some countries (such as Sweden)\nundertake regular surveys of the stress and strain of domestic work and of their consequences\nFigure 2.4. A composite measure of decent work\nSource: International Labour Review, 2003.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n175\nfor health. Developing direct measures of these strains would also be important for\ndeveloping countries, as both the technology (open or primitive stoves) and the fuel used for\nhome cooking (bio fuels) carry much higher health risks for women and children than for\nmen.\nUnpaid domestic work is especially important for the QoL of families with young\nchildren. As most of the time spent caring for children is usually delivered while performing\nother tasks, this time is poorly measured in time-use surveys that do not comprehensively\nrecord “secondary” activities. Also, as most young children spend their time in a variety of\nchild-care arrangements (formal and informal), measures are needed of how these\narrangements are combined (i.e on the share of time that children spend in each). Indicators of\naccess to childcare facilities and its costs are also important to assess the time-crunches faced\nby parents of young children and to better measure the costs of children.\nCommuting\nPeople with paid jobs have a higher QoL when their commuting time is lower. In several\nOECD countries, the combination of higher house prices and stagnant earnings has recently\npushed many workers and their families to live further away from their places of work. This\ndevelopment will weigh heavily on their QoL. A partial but essential indicator of commuting\nis the number of hours spent travelling to and from work during a specified period (week,\nmonth). This type of indicator could be routinely compiled from regular TUS. The\ninformation already available shows large differences in the amount of commuting time\nacross countries (e.g. employed people spend 70 minutes per day commuting, or the\nequivalent of 18 full days per year, in Korea, 36 minutes in France and 29 minutes in the\nUnited States).\nOther dimensions of commuting besides its length are also important for QoL. These\ninclude the accessibility of transport and its affordability, which may affect people’s right to\ndaily mobility. Measuring accessibility and affordability is complex. While accessibility is\npartly captured by measures of commuting time, measuring affordability would require some\nmeasure of household costs and some benchmark to which these costs are compared.\nCommuting costs may also reflect preferences, as some people may opt for more costly\nprivate cars over cheaper public transport. Also important to a sustainability perspective are\nmodes of transport, e.g. availability of bicycle lanes, etc. But statistical feasibility is a\nconcern.\nLeisure time\nLeisure time is a critical dimension of QoL, and a long tradition of research (going back to\nTobin and Nordhaus) has aimed at integrating estimates of its “value” within a broader\nmeasure of money-based well-being. While these efforts raise difficult questions in terms of\nthe appropriate price for valuing leisure, the difficulties in identifying suitable indicators are\nalso important for measuring its quantity. In fact, despite much research about the importance\nof leisure and recreation in shaping QoL, few objective measures of leisure time enjoy\nwidespread use. \nSome possibilities do, however, exist. The most obvious is a simple measure of the\nquantity of leisure time and of the differences between groups and individuals (e.g. by gender)\nin how it is distributed. Estimates of this quantity may be derived from the time-use surveys\n\n176\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nthat are periodically conducted in various countries, but even this raises some problems. One\nproblem is that estimates of leisure time are based on somewhat arbitrary classifications of the\nvarious activities that survey participants report in their time diaries. A second problem is that\nthe amount of time that people allocate to “necessary” activities (such as sleeping, eating and\npersonal care) differs across people and countries, and that these differences will affect the\nestimates of the quantity of leisure time enjoyed in a typical day. When corrected for this\nfactor, available estimates highlight some sizeable cross-country differences in leisure time,\nboth across countries36 and across groups (men enjoy more leisure time than women, with\nlarge differences in Italy and negligible ones in France; leisure-time is also U-shaped with\nrespect to age, OECD, 2009). A last problem, already raised when discussing hedonic\nexperiences, is that different people (e.g. people who are involuntarily unemployed and\npeople with jobs that they like) will derive very different “pleasure” from the same activity\nclassified as “leisure time” in conventional time-use surveys: measures of both the amount of\ntime spent in various activities and of the degree of enjoyment derived from them are needed\nto account for inequalities in leisure time across people. \nOther indicators of the quantity of leisure time also exist. One example is provided by\nindicators of participation/attendance in various leisure activities, such as recreation, sports\nand cultural events. These indicators are available in several countries, and could be collected\nthrough comparable surveys, although no common classification or dedicated survey\ninstrument exists in this field. A different venue could take the form of indicators of “poor\nleisure”, such as the proportion of individuals, families or children that cannot afford a week\nof holidays away from home at least once a year. This type of indictor has a long tradition in\nEuropean countries but remains rare elsewhere.37\nBeyond its “quantity”, measures of the “quality” of leisure time are also important, as they\nmay shed light on some important differences over time and between groups. For example, in\nthe United States highly-educated individuals have less leisure time than less-educated\nindividuals (i.e. they are “money-rich” but “time-poor”). However, when considering other\nmeasures of leisure quality (such as the number of leisure episodes or whether leisure is\nundertaken with other persons or combined with other activities), the quality of leisure\nappears to be higher for the highly educated (Gimenez Nadal and Sevilla Sanz, 2007).\nResearch also shows that, even when men and women have the same amount of free time, its\nquality may be uneven, especially when fears of physical insecurity or assault push women to\nstay at home rather than go outside. While issues related to leisure time may be less pressing\nfor poor countries, these are critical concerns for developed countries.\nHousing\nHousing is an important determinant of QoL as well as of a variety of other social\noutcomes (such as children’s education). It is hence important to identify indicators\ndescribing both its quantity and quality that could be used to benchmark countries’\n36.\nAmong OECD countries, the amount of leisure time in a typical week is lowest in Mexico and Japan (at less\nthan 5 hours per day) and highest in Belgium and Germany (at more than 6½ hours per day).\n37.\nAmong EU countries, close to 10% of households in the Netherlands and in most Nordic countries report that\nthey could not afford a week away from home, as compared to levels above 50% in some countries in Southern\nand Eastern Europe.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n177\nperformance in this field. Housing statistics are indeed available in most countries, and are\nalso collected by some international and regional organizations. Eurostat publishes reports\nand data on housing within the framework of its “urban audit”; and information is also\ncollected by various UN agencies.38 But comparability in this field is a challenge, and no core\nset of housing indicators currently exists for international comparisons of QoL.\nDeveloping a set of housing indicators that could be used in the context of QoL studies\nwould require taking steps in several dimensions:\n• First, all countries would need to develop appropriate measures and definitions of\npeople who are homeless or using emergency shelters. As people in these conditions are\nunlikely to be reached through regular surveys, countries need to use the information\navailable through public programmes and voluntary groups that provide emergency\nrelief to people in these conditions.\n• Second, national and international statistical offices need to develop and make\noperational a concept of “decent housing” (the negative side of which is “poor\nhousing”), with different specifications for developed and less-developed countries.\nDecent housing indicators would help secure recognition of the importance of housing\nrights worldwide.\n• Third, measures of housing quality should be put in place. The criteria for quality\nshould differ between countries at different stages of development. For example, recent\nresearch in Brazil describes adequate housing through (census) data covering\novercrowding (more than two persons per bedroom); availability of safe drinking water;\nwaste collection; and sewage disposal facilities. In developed countries, suitable\nindicators could include, in addition, units lacking complete plumbing, waiting time for\nsubsidized housing, and exposure to noise and pollution. Information on foreclosures on\nprimary residences during the ongoing financial crisis should also be gathered. \nPolitical voice and governance\nWhat is it and why does it matter?\nPolitical voice is an integral dimension of QoL, having both intrinsic and instrumental\nworth. Intrinsically, the ability to participate as full citizens, to have a say in the framing of\npublic policy, to be able to dissent without fear and to speak up against perceived wrongs –\nnot only for oneself but also for others – are essential freedoms and capabilities.39\nInstrumentally, citizens’ voices can provide a corrective to public policy, ensure the\naccountability of governments and public institutions, reveal what people need and value, and\ncall attention to significant human deprivations both in emergency situations (e.g. famine,\nfloods and hurricanes) and over the long term (e.g. poverty, malnutrition and hunger).\nInstitutions that promote participation and public discussion help citizens to make informed\nchoices on many aspects that impinge on their QoL (such as health, education, the\n38.\nSee, for example, the UN sustainable indicators programme (http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/\nindicators/isdms2001/isd-ms2001isd.htm) and the reports of the UN Centre for Human Settlements (e.g. on the\ncauses of inadequate housing in Latin America, http://www.habitat.org/lac_eng/pdf/causes.pdf).\n39.\nOn aspects of this, see also Sen (1999), Nussbaum (2006), Dreze and Sen (2002), and Alkire (2002).\n\n178\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nenvironment, legal rights and civic duties) and to play a role in shaping public values.40\nPolitical voice also reduces the potential for social conflict and enhances the prospect of\nbuilding consensus on key issues, which can increase economic efficiency, social equity, and\ninclusiveness in public life. Political voice can be expressed both individually (such as by\nvoting) and collectively (such as joining a protest rally). In both forms, the opportunities for\nexpression and the degree of responsiveness of the political system (i.e. the extent to which\nthe individual’s voice is actually heard and acted on) will depend on the institutional features\nof each country. Prominent among these features are the presence (or absence) of a\nfunctioning parliamentary democracy, universal suffrage, a free media, and civil society\norganizations.41 \nLegislative guarantees and the rule of law impinge on and enhance the scope of political\nvoice, but they are also independently important and, once again, have both intrinsic and\ninstrumental worth. Intrinsically, the legislative guarantees provided by a government indicate\nto its citizens how fair, just and humane is its vision of society, and how low is its tolerance\nfor human deprivation and the lack of basic freedoms. Such guarantees can take various\nforms, such as constitutional rights prohibiting discrimination by gender, race, religion or\nethnicity, and social rights to education, housing, old-age pensions and health care. In\naddition, laws outside the constitutional framework can provide rights that enhance material\nand non-material welfare. Cases in point are laws that promise a living wage and various\nforms of social security, protection for women against domestic violence, property rights, and\na right to information that citizens can invoke to ask public institutions about their functioning\nand hold them accountable for their decisions. Whether or not a person or group uses the\navailable legal guarantees in practice, the very fact of living in a society that promises such\nguarantees defines the opportunities available to every citizen and thus impinges on their\nperception of their QoL. Instrumentally, legislative guarantees can affect both the economy\nand society. The structure of laws, for example, can affect a country’s investment climate and\nthus have an impact on market functioning, economic growth, job creation and material\nwelfare. \nTo realize their potential, however, the guarantees promised by the law require effective\nimplementation. They require a rule of law that can ensure the provisioning of substantive\njustice and legal implementation, by going beyond paper guarantees to their practical\nrealization. Unfairly or inadequately implemented laws will not only fail to enhance people’s\nQoL but will undermine trust in the state both within the country and internationally.\nEffective implementation, by contrast, will benefit both actual well-being and the perception\nof well-being. Successful implementation depends, however, on how various state\ninstitutions, such as the police, the judiciary and other administrative services, function;\nwhether they are free from corruption, political interference and social prejudice; and whether\nthey can be held accountable for their decisions.\n40.\nAccording to Sunstein (1991) and Young (1993), the process of deliberation can also produce other-\nregarding preferences among the privileged.\n41.\nUsing data for 46 countries, Owen et al. (2008) find a positive correlation between democratic institutions\nand individual levels of subjective well-being. Similar evidence, referring to Swiss cantons, is reported by Frey\nand Stutzer (2002a and 2002b).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n179\nThe accountability of the police and the judiciary is critical to the enforcement of the rule\nof law, while accountability of administrative services is crucial for non-judiciable claims to\npublic policies and programmes. Moreover, the attitudes of judges towards the disadvantaged,\ntheir perception and understanding of people’s lives and circumstances, are important for how\nthe laws are interpreted and whether the legal process provides substantive justice.42\nPolitically appointed judges can bring pre-determined positions and attitudinal biases to the\nimplementation process. Successful implementation of the law also depends on mechanisms\nto ensure that citizens are aware of their legal rights and that legal aid is provided for those\nunable to afford the cost of litigation. Civil society institutions and a free media can also\nprove crucial in holding public institutions accountable and in promoting the rule of law.\nPolitical voice, legislative guarantees and the rule of law matter not only individually but\nalso interactively. Political voice can lead to the establishment, formulation and expansion of\na legal framework that embraces all citizens, by calling attention to missing or faulty laws,\nand lobbying the state to change discriminatory or ineffective laws and instituting new ones.\nCitizens with freedom of voice and assembly can also put pressure on governments for the\nfair implementation of laws, and identify cases where a law has been unfairly applied or\njustice denied. Legislative guarantees in turn can strengthen political voice by providing the\nright of free speech, free association and assembly, and the free exchange of information. All\nthese factors matter both in developed and developing countries.\nIndicators\nIndicators are needed to measure where a country stands in terms of political voice and\ndemocratic governance, as well as legislative guarantees and the rule of law. \n• Citizens can assert voice through a range of institutions and rights – multiparty\nparliamentary democracy and universal suffrage; decentralized government; free media;\nacademic freedoms; and freedom to form and join civil organizations, social\ninstitutions, trade unions and professional bodies. Citizens’ voices can thus be\nexpressed through both political institutions and institutions that fall outside the remit of\nformal politics. In addition, indicators are needed to assess what rights, freedoms,\nopportunities and voice can be exercised by non-citizens – whose numbers have been\nrising in many countries with growing international migration.\n• Legislative guarantees include rights embedded in constitutions (e.g. non-\ndiscrimination on the basis of race or gender; right to food, education, etc.); laws that\npromote civil and criminal justice, equality, inclusion and accountability (e.g. freedom\nof information); laws on affirmative action; international covenants that uphold\nprinciples of human rights and basic freedoms ratified by a country; and other legal\nguarantees of various kinds. \n• The rule of law includes institutions that ensure de facto rights and not simply de jure\nrights. An independent judiciary, free from corruption and political influences, the\nspeed with which justice is delivered, economic and social access to the law for all\ncitizens (including women and religious and ethnic minorities) are all potentially\ninformative indicators. \n42.\nFor elaboration, see Nussbaum (2007).\n\n180\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nA list of useful indicators on the dimensions mentioned above is provided in Table 2.1.\nEach of these dimensions could potentially be measured through both objective and\nsubjective indicators (i.e. people’s perceptions of the items listed). In using subjective\nindicators, however, caution is needed to avoid the possibility that perceptions may provide a\nmore positive reading of a situation than actual experience might indicate (or vice versa). A\nsubstantial literature on adaptive preferences highlights, for instance, that disadvantaged\npeople may adapt their preferences to their unfavourable circumstances and claim to be\nbetter-off (e.g. in better health) than indicated by their objective conditions43.\nTable 2.1. Potentially useful indicators to measure political voice, legal guarantees \nand the rule of law \nDespite the importance of political voice for QoL – and the array of international\norganizations and universities that have identified indicators and collected information on\nthem, some on a regular basis and others occasionally – reliable measures remain limited.\nMost of the existing indicators are compiled by bodies outside the boundaries of national\nstatistical systems (Appendix 2.1). The information collection methodology typically\ninvolves drawing on expert opinions about how countries are performing in terms of\ndemocracy, corruption and freedoms. Cases in point are the Freedom House and Polity IV\nindicators, and the set of governance indicators regularly compiled by the World Bank\nInstitute (Kaufmann, Kraay and Mastruzzi, 2008)44. While experts’ assessments are useful in\nsome fields, such as concerning the existence of particular institutions of governance or\nlegislative guarantees, they are also clearly inadequate for assessing how adequately or fairly\nsuch institutions function, or how people perceive them. To measure these aspects requires\npopulation surveys that provide information on citizens’ perceptions of the functioning of\n43.\nFor conceptual discussions on adapted preferences, see Sen (1987) and Nussbaum (2001); for an\nempirical assessment, see Burchardt (2005). On how people’s preferences are shaped by existing\nendowments, see Sunstein (1993). \nDemocratic participation : Multiparty \ndemocracy; universal suffrage; free, fair \nand regular elections; voter turnout\nConstitutional guarantees: number of \nguarantees built into the constitution\nJudicial institutions : existence of an \nindependent judiciary\nParticipation in governance : \nDecentralised institutions of governance; \nrepresentation of women, minorities, etc. \nin political and executive institutions of \ngovernment \nLegal guarantees for basic economic \nneeds :  employment, food, education, \nhealth care, housing, etc. \nEqual access to and treatment for all:  by \nethnicity, religion, race and gender, etc. \n(needs sub-indicators of access)\nSupport from outside government : \nExistence and number of secular civil \nsociety organisations; free media\nPolitical and social rights guaranteed by \nlaw: right to information, freedom from \ndomestic violence, etc.\nFunctioning of legal institutions  for civil \nand criminal redressal\nRatification of international treaties  for \nequality, human rights, etc.\nArrests and detention of political \nprisoners\nCitizens’ Voice\nLegislative Guarantees\nRule of Law\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n181\nthese institutions. Such surveys are rare45. Also, there is very limited information on\ninequalities (predicated on race, gender, ethnicity or minority status) in access to legal redress,\non differences in perceptions of the ways in which political, legal and executive institutions\nfunction, and on the trust that disadvantaged groups in the population place in these\ninstitutions.\nComparisons based on existing indicators of political voice, democratic governance,\nlegislative guarantees and the rule of law highlight vast differences between countries.\nAlthough many countries have moved away from dictatorship and authoritarian regimes over\nthe past two decades, their transition towards establishing the full range of democratic\nfreedoms, rights and the rule of law has been difficult and slow. Effective indicators can help\nmonitor the consolidation of democracy in these countries: to this end, several recent\ninitiatives are aimed at improving these countries’ capacity to develop indicators in these\nfields, which could be used to formulate and evaluate national policies.46 \nAvailable indicators that focus on political institutions show little or no variation among\nthe established democracies.47 This, however, is more a reflection of the data collected than\nof the views of their residents (Ringen, 2007). Even in the developed world, low trust in\npublic institutions and declining political participation point to a growing gap in how citizens\nand political elites perceive the functioning of democratic institutions. For example, in a\nsurvey of OECD countries, on average only 44% of respondents reported high trust in the\ncivil service, and less than 40% reported high trust in the legislative and executive branches of\ngovernment, so in some countries the levels were even lower (OECD, 2006a). The exercise of\npolitical voice also differs systematically across countries and groups of people: for example,\nyounger, less-educated and lower-income people are less likely to vote (OECD, 2006a); and,\nwith higher immigration, rising numbers of non-residents lack fundamental rights and\nopportunities for political participation. The functioning of political systems in developed\ncountries also provides plenty of examples of how rights are transgressed, such as by unequal\nrepresentation of people before the law, biases in legal procedures, the purchase of political\npower through direct payments to decision-makers and contributions to campaign financing,\nand lobbying by sectoral interest groups (Okun, 1975). Suitable indicators are thus needed to\nassess the quality of democratic governance within established market economies as well.48\n44.\nThe Polity IV project measures the “degree of democracy” on a year-by-year basis for all independent states\non a scale from +10 (most democratic) to -10 (least democratic). The indicators cover: i) the existence of a\nfunctioning central political authority; ii) openness or closedness of political institutions; iii) durability of the\ncentral political authority (number of years since the last regime transformation); iv) institutionalised procedures\nfor the transfer of executive power; v) competition in executive recruitment; vi) independence of the chief\nexecutive; vii) institutional structures of political expression; and viii) competitiveness of participation.\n45.\nOne example is the survey undertaken by “Reporters without Borders” to measure press freedom. At the\nregional level, another example is provided by the survey conducted in South Asia to map citizens’ opinions and\nattitudes (SDSA, 2008): this survey includes questions about the perceived gap between constitutional guarantees\nand their realization, perceptions about political and executive institutional functioning, freedom from fear or from\na feeling of insecurity, and freedom from want (hunger, poverty).\n46.\nProminent among these initiatives are the Metagora project, launched in 2004 under the auspices of the\nOECD/PARIS21 network (OECD, 2008a); and the UNDP Global Programme on Capacity Development for\nDemocratic Governance Assessments and Measurements.\n47.\nAmong the 28 OECD countries covered in Polity IV, one has a score of 7, four have a score of 8, one has a\nscore of 9, and the 22 others all have a score of 10.\n\n182\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nSocial connections\nLike political voice and the rule of law, social connections and the attendant norms of trust\nand trustworthiness are important for people’s QoL. These social connections are sometimes\nsubsumed under the heading of “social capital”. Definitions of social capital (as were other\nforms of “capital” at an equivalent stage in their conceptual development) have been much\ndebated, but there is now convergence towards a “lean and mean” definition: social networks\nand the associated norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness.49 Since it is impractical to\nmeasure social networks at large geographic levels, researchers generally rely on proxies for\nthese networks (e.g. number of close friends, political participation, membership in voluntary\nassociations, religious involvement, doing favours, etc.). The core insight of the concept of\nsocial capital is that, like tools (physical capital) and training (human capital), social\nconnections have value for QoL.50 \nSocial connections have value, first, to the people who are in the networks. For example,\nlabour markets are permeated by networks, so that most people are as likely to get their jobs\nthrough whom they know as through what they know. Similarly, social connections bring\nbenefits for health: as a risk factor for premature death, social isolation rivals smoking\n(Berkman and Glass, 2000). Evidence also suggests that social connections are powerful\npredictors of (and probably causes of) subjective well-being. Finally, the same personal\nactivity can have different impacts on subjective well-being, depending on whether it is\nconducted alone or with others. \nAll these are “internal” effects of social networks, since they represent ways in which\nsocial networks benefit people in those networks. Social connections, however, also have\n“externalities”, i.e. implications for bystanders. The literature on “social capital” has brought\nout clearly a number of examples of positive externalities. For example, neighbourhood\nnetworks can deter crime (Sampson 2003), and this effect also benefits residents who sit at\nhome in front of their TV. The performance of democratic government and even the pace of\neconomic growth may also depend on the quality of social connections within a\njurisdiction.51. Finally, several (mainly US) studies suggest that both child welfare (infant\nmortality, teen pregnancy, low birth-weight babies, teen drug use, etc.) and school\nperformance (drop-out rates, test scores) are robustly predicted by measures of community\nsocial capital.\n48.\nRingen (2007) describes differences in democratic governance among developed market economies through\nindicators of the strength of the democratic process (i.e. the timing of introduction of universal suffrage, and a\nmeasure of freedom of the press); of its capacity (i.e. a composite indicator of government effectiveness and a\nqualitative indicator of protection against the political use of economic power); of the people’s trust (i.e. trust in\nparliament and the civil service); and of the security that the political system provides to people (i.e. against risks\nof poverty and the affects of illness). \n49.\nWhile various forms of “social trust” fall outside this narrow definition, they are included in discussions of\nsocial capital because they are common, empirically important by-products of dense social networks. Generic\nmeasures of social trust are widely used as proxies for social capital in international comparisons.\n50.\nA rich literature also underscores the value of networks for economic development and the functioning of\nmarkets.\n51.\nThese claims, first suggested by Putnam (1993), have been confirmed by a number of more rigorous\nresearchers, both in Italy and elsewhere.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n183\nHowever, the “externalities” stemming from networks can also be negative. A strong sense\nof belonging to one group can strengthen a sense of a unique personal identity in terms of the\ngroup to which he or she belongs (Sen, 2006). This may generate fissures in national\ncommunities, and breed a climate of violence and confrontation. More generally, a long-\nstanding tradition in economics has stressed the potential for groups to generate benefits for\ninsiders that weigh heavily on the opportunities and QoL of outsiders. In other words, groups\ncan foster bonds among participants but also erect walls with respect to outsiders and\nmembers of other groups. To account for these multiple effects, research distinguishes\nbetween two types of social capital, “bonding” and “bridging”, but practical implementation\nof this distinction in empirical research remains a challenge.\nIn short, a rich literature from several disciplines shows that social connections benefit\npeople in the networks, with effects on non-participants that depend on both the nature of the\ngroup and the effects being considered.52 In some cases, like health, studies have\ndemonstrated that social connections can have positive effects at both the “individual” and\n“aggregate” level: people with more friends live longer in part because of the biochemical\neffects of social isolation, and in part because public health systems are more effective in\nareas of higher social capital. Many of these “causal” claims are yet to be tested with an\nexperimental or quasi-experimental design, but even on this score progress is slowly being\nmade. A high priority for research in this field is more work on causal linkages using natural\nor randomized experiments. \nSocial connections increase quality of life\nMuch evidence at both the aggregate and individual level suggests that social connections\nare among the most robust predictors of subjective measures of life satisfaction. Social\nconnections have a strong independent effect on subjective well-being, net of income.53\nMoreover, the available evidence also suggests that the externalities of social capital on well-\nbeing are typically positive, not negative (Helliwell, 2001; Powdthavee, 2008). In other\nwords, increasing my social capital increases both my own and my neighbours’ subjective\nwell-being, and thus represents a coherent strategy for improving QoL for the country as a\nwhole. \nThe analysis of the effects of social connections on subjective well-being is in its infancy.\nMuch of it does not account for unmeasured individual characteristics, and most of it relies on\ncross-sectional data. That said, recent analyses have strengthened the case that the link\nbetween at least some forms of social connections and subjective well-being is causal.\nKrueger, Kahneman et al. (2008) 54 report that, when controlling for individual fixed effects\n(such as personality traits), most pleasurable activities involve socializing — religious\nactivities, eating/drinking, sports, and receiving friends. Similarly, in a recent large-scale US\n52.\nFor a summary of some of this literature, see Putnam (2000).\n53.\nHelliwell and Putnam (2004) summarize their review by saying: “Social connections, including marriage, of\ncourse, but not limited to that, are among the most robust correlates of subjective wellbeing. People who have\nclose friends and confidants, friendly neighbours and supportive co-workers are less likely to experience sadness,\nloneliness, low self-esteem and problems with eating and sleeping…[S]ubjective wellbeing is best predicted by the\nbreadth and depth of one’s social connections. In fact, people themselves report that good relationships with family\nmembers, friends or romantic partners — far more than money or fame — are prerequisites for their own\nhappiness.”\n\n184\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\npanel survey on religious attendance and subjective well-being, Lim and Putnam (2008)\nfound that religious attendance at time1 (or time2) predicted subjective well-being at time2,\ncontrolling for levels of subjective well-being at time1, as well as many other covariates; the\nessential mechanism involved in this relation is neither theological nor psychological, but\nrather the strong effect of “friends at church” on well-being.55 Fowler and Christakis (2008)\nalso report evidence suggesting that subjective well-being can spread in a beneficially\n“contagious” way from one person to another. For no other class of variables (including\nstrictly economic variables) is the evidence for causal effects on subjective well-being\nprobably as strong as it is for social connections.\nIndicators\nAs research on social connections is relatively new, national statistics are still rudimentary.\nMost researchers have relied on unofficial sources. One proxy of social connections often\nused is the number of associations in civil society or church to which each person belongs.\nHowever, the fragility of such measures is, by now, well recognized. A formal organization\nwith a name and address may not correspond to any actual individual members, much less to\nsocial networks among those members. Moreover, the role of associations differs from\ncountry to country. Because of these reasons, measures of organizational density are generally\nnot good measures of social connections, despite their frequent use for that purpose.\nA related approach measures the activities assumed to be the result of social connections,\nsuch as altruistic behaviour. Thus, some research has used blood donations, membership in\nvoluntary organizations or charitable giving as proxies. Other studies have relied on some\naggregate measures of individual behaviour like voting turnout, based on the argument that,\neven though balloting is a private activity, participation in voting is higher in countries with a\ndense network of political parties or civic organizations, and that in all countries members of\nthese organizations have a higher probability of voting. Other studies have used proxy\nmeasures of social connections based on information on family ties, such as marriage rates,\nthough social changes throughout the world have made these an imperfect measure of\nenduring interpersonal ties.\nUltimately, however, all these indicators are inadequate proxies of social connections, and\nreliable indicators can only be constructed through survey data. Only personal reports allow\nmeasuring the many and evolving forms of social connectedness. In recent years a number of\nstatistical offices (in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and\nmost recently, the United States) have begun to gather and report survey-based measures of\nvarious forms of social connections. As an example of these endeavours, Appendix 2.2\npresents the list of the questions included (since early 2008) in an annual Supplement to the\nNovember US Current Population Survey, which has traditionally probed respondents about\nvoting in national elections.56 These questions have been selected after extensive vetting by\n54.\nThe paper used random time-sampling to elicit emotional reactions to various activities. Other cross-\nsectional analyses have controlled for personality types and found persistent effects of social capital on well-being,\ne.g. Helliwell (2005).\n55.\nChaeyoon and Putnam (2008) report that while SWB generally rises with the number of one’s “close\nfriends”, friends at church (at least in America) seem to be “super-charged” friends, in the sense that the effect size\non SWB is roughly twice as great as for “close friends”.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n185\nthe Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for reliability, intelligibility, and\ninoffensiveness; they cover several manifestations of civic and political engagement, as well\nas other forms of social connections (such as number of friends, or frequency of contacts and\nfavours done for neighbours).57 \nMeasuring social connections, however, goes beyond measuring these particular aspects.\nAlso needed are suitably tested questions assessing people’s experience in a range of other\ndomains. Some of the most important domains that could be explored through dedicated\nsurveys include the following:58\n• Social trust. Despite only moderate test-retest reliability, the canonical social trust\nquestion has been asked thousands of times in many countries: its behaviour is well\nunderstood, and it allows many comparisons across time and space.59 Moreover, at the\naggregate level (e.g. states/nations), responses are highly stable over time (even when\nindividual-level stability is low), suggesting that this question measures a very\npredictive characteristic of communities. Data on social trust are also significant\ndeterminants of subjective well-being. Compared to this canonical question, questions\nabout “lost wallets” are potentially more reliable, since they are more specific and\nquasi-behavioural.60 Opportunities for comparison across time and space are, however,\nscant, and we still lack studies of its variability across time for the same person. \n• Social isolation. Lack of contacts with other people in normal daily living is both a\nsymptom and a cause of social distress, and it can lead to a downward spiral affecting\nmorale and reducing social and economic opportunities. Social isolation can be\nmeasured through questions asking people about the frequency of their contacts with\nothers or about how often they spend their time socializing with family members,\nfriends and work colleagues or with other people in sports, religious and cultural\nassociations. Social connections are also a function of living arrangements (i.e. living\nalone) and employment status (e.g. having a job). Research has highlighted strong\nassociations between the degree of social isolation of each person and measures of their\nwell-being, self-assurance, ability and power of action, and activity (Ringen, 2008)\n• Informal support. Questions about the availability of social support in case of need\nhave been used in many countries. The Gallup World Poll includes a yes/no question\nabout friends or relatives “you can count on”; answers to this question are highly\n56.\nThese questions about political engagement might, in fact, be best seen as measures of “political voice”, as\ndiscussed earlier in this report.\n57.\nQuestions on local voting are often found to be more reliable and to display higher variance than voting in\nnational elections, probably because it is less subject to “social desirability” response bias. Empirically, such\nquestions have proved to be among the best single measure of political engagement more generally.\n58.\nThis list largely overlaps with that proposed by an ad hoc blue ribbon interdisciplinary working group, and\nreproduced in Appendix 3; these items (and the associated questions) have not yet been accepted by the Census\nBureau for inclusion in the Current Population Survey.\n59.\n“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing\nwith people?”\n60.\n“If you lost a wallet or a purse that contained two hundred dollars, and it was found by a neighbour, how\nlikely is it to be returned with the money in it? Would you say very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely or\nnot at all likely?”\n\n186\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\npredictive of subjective well-being but have little discriminatory power (about 90% of\nrespondents answer this question affirmatively). This suggests that alternative\nformulations or more nuanced responses may be needed (e.g., “if yes, how many?”, or\nspecifying the type of help expected in various specific contingencies).\n• Workplace engagement. For many people in many countries, a large fraction of all their\nsocial connections are with workmates, either in the workplace or outside of it.\nHelliwell and Huang (2005) found that trust in workmates is a robust predictor of life\nsatisfaction. Questions about trust in workmates have been tested in some countries\n(e.g. North America).\n• Religious engagement. While there is general agreement that religion is an important\nform of social connections, the introduction of specific survey questions (even when\nextensively vetted) raises issues of political sensitivity. Identifying suitable\nformulations of these questions is important as, in most countries, religious engagement\nis a robust predictor of subjective well-being and (in many countries outside Europe) it\nis a large fraction of all social networks. \n• Bridging social capital (i.e. friendships across lines of race, religion, class, etc.) is the\nmost important under-measured form of social connections for many outcomes. The\ninformal advisory committee to the US Current Population Survey recommended that a\nsuitable measure of bridging social capital could take the form of follow-on probes of\nthe form, “Of these close friends, how many are... (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic,\nCatholic, Jewish, college-educated, etc.)”. This bridging question is least susceptible to\nresponse bias and political correctness.61 \nAggregation\nOne important issue for the measurement of social connections is aggregation. Social\nconnections come in many forms that are useful in many different contexts. These forms,\nhowever, are heterogeneous and not fungible, i.e. they are good only for certain purposes and\nnot others. Further, the exact pathways between networks and benefits (both internal and\nexternal) differ from case to case, and much work remains to be done on those mechanisms.\nLast, although networks can affect our ability to get things done, nothing guarantees that what\ngets done will be socially beneficial.62\nBecause of these considerations, it is not obvious whether all different forms of social\nconnections can be simply “added up” to produce a summary for a given community or\ncountry. Nevertheless, composite indices, based on various indicators, can sometimes\ngenerate useful information about differences in social capital across space. Figure 2.5 shows\na composite measure of social capital across US states based on 14 different indicators.63\nWhile these measures are fairly closely inter-correlated, this state-level index is a strong\n61.\nAppendix 2.3 presents the list of questions concerning social trust, religious engagement and local voting\nthat, while not included in the CPS supplementary module, could be used for measuring these other forms of social\nconnections.\n62.\nAl Qaeda, for instance, is an excellent example of social capital used for disruptive purposes, enabling its\nparticipants to accomplish goals that they could not accomplish without that network. The same is true of human\nand physical capital, both of which can be put to malevolent purposes (as Al Qaeda’s attacks also illustrate).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n187\npredictor (after controlling for other variables such as income, race and education) of child\nwelfare; credit defaults; crime (especially murder); government efficiency; happiness;\nhospital quality; mortality rates; public corruption; school test scores; sexually transmitted\ndiseases; support for civil liberties; tax evasion; teen pregnancy; and Social Security fraud.\nWhile causality remains an unresolved issue, this fairly crude measure of “social capital”\nclearly is picking up something that is correlated with an astonishing array of measures of\nindividual and collective QoL. A composite measure of social connections should be explored\nto monitor developments over time and to benchmark performance across countries.\nSumming up\nOverall, while much remains to be done in the area of measuring social connections,\nsignificant progress has been achieved, at least in some countries and for selected areas.\nSocial connections have been measured parsimoniously, based on replicable and standardized\nmeasures. This suggests that better and more comparable measures of social connections\ncould be developed, building on the experience accumulated by a number of countries.\n63.\nSome of these 14 indicators are survey-based (e.g. “How many times last year did you entertain at home?”),\nsome are organizational (e.g. number of civic and social organizations per 1000 people), and some measure\nindividual behaviour (e.g. electoral turnout). This composite measure has been computed by Robert Putnam.\nFigure 2.5. A composite measure of social capital in the United States\nSource: Robert Putnam.\n\n188\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nEnvironmental conditions\nEnvironmental conditions are at the centre of concerns about the sustainability of current\ndevelopment paths (they are discussed in Chapter 3 of this report), while some of the key\ninteractions between the economy and the environment have led to efforts (mentioned in\nChapter 1) to extend conventional accounting tools. Environmental conditions, however, also\naffect the QoL of people living today in very immediate ways. First, they affect human health\nboth directly (through air and water pollution, hazardous substances and noise) and indirectly\n(through climate change, transformations in the carbon and the water cycles, biodiversity loss\nand natural disasters that affect the health of ecosystems). Secondly, people benefit from\nenvironmental services, such as access to clean water and nature, and their rights in this field\n(including rights to access environmental information) have been increasingly recognized.\nThird, people value environmental amenities or disamenities, and these valuations affect their\nactual choices (e.g. of where to live). Lastly, environmental conditions may lead to climatic\nvariations and natural disasters, such as drought and flooding, which damage both the\nproperty and the lives of the affected populations. Measuring the effects of environmental\nconditions on people’s lives is, however, complex; further, the strength of these relations is\noften underestimated due to limits in current scientific understanding and to the various time\nscales over which these effects manifest themselves.\nEnvironmental conditions and human health \nWhile much progress has been made in OECD countries in reducing some health risks\nrelated to environmental conditions, several surveys highlight persistent concerns of the\npopulation about the impact of various pollutants on their own health and that of their\noffspring. The burden of disease due to environmental factors is estimated at 24% of the total\nburden of disease (WHO, 2008). The prevalence of chronic conditions (e.g. birth defects,\ncancer and respiratory diseases) with links to environmental exposure is also rising. Although\nindividual choices about smoking, diet and exercise are strong contributors to chronic disease,\nexposure to pollutants also matter. In most cases, cost-effective responses to these concerns\nare available; in addition, both research and precautionary measures are needed to better\nassess these long-term effects and to guard against their possible consequences for human\nhealth.\nThe measurement of environmentally-related diseases and disorders has been piecemeal.\nThere have been improvements in several countries, however, as witnessed by large\nreductions in health risks related to lead and to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). In other\ncases, the measurement of the effects of these environmentally-related diseases and exposure\nto environmental risks requires improvements in the collection of data, aggregation across\nvarious environmental factors, and the sharing of information (Box 2.5). Some environmental\nconditions affect the entire population in similar ways, while others are concentrated on\nspecific groups, such as children, the elderly and the poor. For instance, children bear a\ndisproportionate share of the burden of environmentally-related disease, as they ingest or\nbreathe more pollution per unit of body weight than adults exposed to the same\nconcentrations; children are also more exposed to some contaminants because of diet and\nlifestyle factors, with consequences for asthma, birth defects, cancer and cognitive\ndevelopment. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n189\nBox 2.5.  Box  Environmental effects on human health\nA range of environmental conditions affects human health (e.g. air pollution, water pollution,\nhazardous substances, noise). Some of the most important include the following:\n•\nOutdoor air pollution: conventional pollutants such as particulate matter, sulphur oxides, nitrogen\noxides, ground level ozone and lead have a range of health effects, such as irritation of the respiratory\npassages, increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses, and early death in sensitive groups such as\nthe elderly and asthmatics. Despite extensive regulations, many of these factors (such as ground level\nozone and particulate matter) continue to cause large numbers of premature deaths (Figure 2.6). \n•\nIndoor air pollution: radon, environmental tobacco smoke, chemicals, mould and humidity place\nindoor air pollution among the top five environmental risks for public health (USEPA, 2003). This\nreflects the large share of time that people spend indoors (around 90% of the total) and the high\nconcentrations of these pollutants (often ten times higher than outdoor levels) in some low-quality\ndwellings where people work and live.64\n•\nIndustrial chemicals are dispersed in the environment worldwide, with potential effects on\nreproductive capacity, birth defects, cancer, acute illness and skin reactions. Of the 70 000 to 100 000\nchemicals in use, 4 800 “high volume” chemicals represent the bulk of the total production. The\nassessment of the hazards associated with these high-volume chemicals has been completed for less\nthan 700, as progress requires large amounts of data and the co-operation of chemical manufacturers\n(OECD, 2008a). As significant progress has been achieved worldwide for a few substances such as\nlead, international attention has now shifted to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercur65y.\nResidues of pesticides (e.g. insecticides, herbicides, fungicides) are also present in several food\nproducts, in some cases in amounts high enough to harm the nervous system, especially in children. \n•\nEndocrine disruptors are chemicals that interfere with the functioning of the endocrine system. These\nsubstances have raised much concern in recent years, as metabolic breakdown compounds from\npharmaceutical products, which enter the environment with treated wastewater, may disrupt hormonal\nsystems of fish and amphibians and, by interfering with the normal functioning of hormones and\nreceptors, perturb both childhood development and adult reproductive health.\n64.\nRadon is a naturally-occurring, odourless and colourless gas: it is estimated to be responsible for around\n2 500 cases of lung cancers each year in France, and for 21 000 cases in the United States. ETS includes some 200\nknown toxic substances, most of which are classified as carcinogenic: in the United States, it is estimated to be\nresponsible for between 150 000 to 300 000 lower respiratory tract infections annually in infants (under 18\nmonths), and to increase the frequency and severity of asthma episodes for 200 000 to 1 million children.\nAsbestos, a mineral fibre, was widely used as a building insulator and fire retardant up to the 1980s and was later\nrecognized, in some countries, as a carcinogen; in France, it is responsible for around 2 000 deaths from lung\ncancer per year.\n65.\nThe Stockholm Convention on POPs is being implemented, and a Convention on mercury is being prepared.\nSeveral countries (such as Finland, Sweden and the United States) have issued repeated or permanent warnings to\ntheir population not to eat certain fish species from some marine or freshwater bodies due to PCBs. In Japan, about\nJPY200 billion have been allocated over decades to the victims of Minamata disease (resulting from mercury),\nmostly paid by the polluting company.\n\n190\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nAccess to environmental services\nDespite being recognized as a human right, access to clean water and sanitation at an\naffordable price remains a major concern in many parts of the world. One billion people are\nestimated to lack access to clean water, and 2.5 billion to sanitation services (UNDP, 2006).\nAn inadequate sanitation infrastructure results in diseases caused by viruses, bacteria (such as\ncholera and E. Coli) and parasites (e.g. cryptosporidiosis). To meet this challenge, the\nMillennium Development Goals include the goal of halving the proportion of people without\naccess to water supply and sanitation. \nAccess to water and sanitation differ widely among countries, with OECD countries\nbenefiting from much better water supplies and sanitation services than developing countries.\nFor rural populations, access to water is critical for agricultural production: this sector\nrepresents 70% of water abstraction in the world, and in many countries rural populations\nrank water supply as their top concern. Water supply is also a constraint on economic\ndevelopment in countries such as Australia, Turkey, Mexico, and Spain as well as in\nCalifornia (OECD, 2006b). Governments, firms and NGOs are actively involved in solving\nproblems in the financing and governance of the water supply. While in most OECD\ncountries, improvements to the water supply infrastructure have led to the quasi-elimination\nof health disorders associated with pathogenic agents (such as cholera), concern now relates\nto human exposure to lead in drinking water, mainly resulting from lead pipes and solder used\non copper pipes. Regulations in Europe and the United States restricting lead levels in\ndrinking water have led to the gradual replacement of lead service lines.\nAssuring access to nature and outdoor recreational areas has also gained in importance\nwith the growing awareness of the health and economic costs of a sedentary lifestyle,\nparticularly for urban populations. Parks in cities and natural areas in peri-urban zones\nprovide opportunities for physical exercise, recreational activities and relaxation. Forested\nland and areas featuring agreeable landscapes and uncontaminated water bodies benefit QoL\nin various ways. Outdoor activities can contribute to good health and well-being, and help to\ncombat obesity, which is a public health issue in most OECD countries.\nFigure 2.6.Premature deaths from air pollution, per million inhabitants\nSource: OECD (2008b), OECD Environmental Outlook, OECD, Paris.\n \nDue to ozone concentrations\nDue to particulate m atter (10 m icrom eters or less, PM 10)\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1 000\nPacif ic\nEuro p e\nNo rth Am erica\nAsia\nBrazil\nRussia\nChina\nSo uth Asia         \n(includ ing  Ind ia)\nRest o f  the Wo rld\nWo rld\nOECD\n2000\n2030\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPacif ic\nEuro p e\nNo rth Am erica\nAsia\nBrazil\nRussia\nChina\nSo uth Asia (including Ind ia)\nRest o f  the Wo rld\nWo rld\nOECD\n2000\n2030\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n191\nAccess to environmental information has been established as a right over the last ten years\nin a number of countries (building on the Aarhus Convention and a number of other\ninternational agreements). This right of access to environmental information was also\nincluded in the preamble to the French Constitution. In most OECD countries, much progress\nhas been made in terms of providing access to such information as an essential dimension of\n“environmental democracy”. Progress has been made in implementing this right, as citizens\nare now more able to obtain, at their request, much information, at low or limited cost, on\nmatters of concern such as environmental risks and the facilities, institutions and services\navailable in their country, region or neighbourhood. The full implementation of laws on\nintegrated prevention and control, as well as the existence of facilitators and mediators, has\nalso enhanced the public’s right to know about environmental conditions and hazards.\nExtending the right to access environmental information to more countries in the world is part\nof the extension of people’s right to access general administrative information.\nEnvironmental amenities and disamenities\nIn most developed countries, noise is ranked high by people in surveys about their own\nliving conditions. Peace and quiet are valued particularly by urban populations. Noise has\nextended over time and space, and the total acoustic energy produced has increased over time.\nTo enhance the QoL of residents and to improve the quality of tourism, authorities in some\ncountries have designated quiet areas in nature, rural, mountainous or other specific areas\n(such as lakes), while others have implemented noise curfews during certain time periods\n(e.g. at night). \nExposure to noise is of concern for QoL because of its effects on physical and\npsychological health, behaviours and social activities. The effects on human health include\nannoyance, hearing impairment (for extreme exposure) and risk of cardiovascular disease\nfrom chronic exposure. Noise affects sleep, cognitive performance (especially for children)\nand speech. The cost of noise damage has been estimated at between 0.2% and 2% of GDP\nannually (EU, 2001). People are mainly exposed to noise from street and road traffic, railways\nand air traffic, as well as factories and construction work. Children and youth are more\nsensitive to high noise levels, which can lead to slower learning, long-term hearing damage or\ntinnitus.\nLow environmental quality also raises safety concerns in risk-prone areas. “External\nsafety” in a strict sense refers to the hazards facing people living near industrial installations\nand hazardous substances transport routes, for example, near large chemical plants (e.g.\nToulouse accident), or around airports (e.g. Amsterdam accident) and railway yards. External\nsafety is distinguished from (but not unrelated to) safety internal to the facilities or vehicles.\nWhile there may be important gaps between actual risks and the risks perceived by\npopulations, both have a claim to matter for QoL. Also, large differences in perception may\noccur between those working within (or familiar with) a facility and those less familiar with\nit. While disaster prevention and control concerns everyone, progress in access to\nenvironmental information and corporate environmental reporting is needed to allay these\nfears. \nPeople value environmental amenities such as green landscape, shorelines, mountains,\nlight and tranquillity. People also express concern about the disamenities associated with\nnoise or living near environmental infrastructures such as wastewater treatment plants, waste\n\n192\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nlandfills, and incinerators. Such concerns often lead local populations to resist the\nestablishment of such facilities, even those of the highest standards, near the areas where they\nlive. Some of these concerns relate to the effect of pollution on health, some to the effect on\nland and housing values; both can be captured through data on market housing transactions\nand estimates of hedonic prices.66\nClimatic variations and “natural” disasters\nMost countries face seasonal or local problems with water volumes, such as seasonal\ndroughts, shrinking groundwater reserves or falling groundwater tables. Furthermore, there is\na risk that climate change will affect rainfall distribution and evaporation, resulting in the\nincreased frequency and intensity of extreme weather episodes, including floods, droughts,\nhigh winds and rising sea levels. Potential damage would be mainly to property in developed\ncountries, and to human life in developing countries.\nMany countries are threatened by major floods, which have severe economic and social\nimpacts. In recent years, major flooding has occurred in the Rhine basin, Central Europe,\nFrance and other countries. Some of these floods have led to economic losses equivalent to a\nfew percent of GDP, with most of the damage uninsured. In many countries, the frequency\nand severity of river flooding has increased in recent years. In 2005, storm and storm-related\nflood damage (e.g. from Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Wilma) caused insured property losses\nestimated at over USD 80 billion (OECD, 2006c). Since 1970, out of the 40 most costly\nevents in terms of insured losses 10 have involved floods, four of them in 2005. In most\ndeveloped countries, people affected by flood damage may receive some compensation from\ngovernment and insurers. If flood insurance premiums were to be raised to fully match\ninsurance claims, people living in flood-prone areas would face a drastic rise in their housing\ncosts or perhaps simply be unable to get insurance at all. \nRecent assessments indicate that current patterns of water use are unsustainable in many\ncountries. An increasing incidence of local and regional droughts would lead to more water\ncrises. The effects would be felt most by regions where water stress is already high. Several\ndeveloped countries, or regions thereof, are in this category. The QoL of farmers is first\naffected. In Australia, many of them are living on drought compensation payments which had\nto be maintained over the years, and they may have to leave their land (OECD, 2008). In some\nparts of the world, large forest fires have been associated with drought, leading to threats,\ndamages and casualties for peri-urban populations (Australia, Greece, Portugal and\nCalifornia). Rising seawater is a considerable threat to populations, and is potentially\nexacerbated by climatic variations (e.g. high winds or tornados resulting from such variations\ncan cause seawater rises). The potential damage in terms of lost lives and property is\nconsiderable, as significant population and infrastructure are concentrated in coastal areas.\n66.\nEstimates of hedonic pricing builds on individuals’ willingness to pay for residential property (or rather its\ncharacteristics) and separates the economic valuation of other characteristics of this property from the valuation of\nenvironmental amenities such as a mountain view or access to a park (or, more broadly, environmental features,\nincluding pollution and noise). Hedonic pricing has the advantage of being based on actual choices (as opposed to\nopinion surveys of preferences); it relies on information on property markets, and can be applied to a range of\nenvironmental amenities and disamenities. Its limits include its high demands on data and statistical competencies,\nas well as assumptions that the property market is not disturbed by changes in taxation, lending or mortgage\nconditions external to the underlying model.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n193\nIndicators: what is available and what is needed\nMuch progress has been achieved in the last two decades in terms of measuring\nenvironmental conditions (building on better environmental data, accounting tools, opinion\nsurveys, and the regular monitoring of indicators67), understanding their impacts (e.g.\nevaluation of related morbidity and mortality, labour productivity, the economic stakes\nassociated with climate change, biodiversity change, damage by disasters) and establishing a\nright of access to environmental information. However, because of the limits both of\neconomic accounting and of composite indices of environmental quality, the most pragmatic\nand reliable approach to measuring environmental conditions continues to rely on physical\nindicators. Several environmental indicators are already available. Some of them refer to\npressures on the environment from economic activities (such as emissions), others to\nresponses from administration, enterprises or households to environmental degradation (such\nas environmental expenditure), and still others to the actual state of environmental quality\n(such as ambient air quality). The principal function of these indicators has been to support\nthe design and implementation of environmental policies, and to track environmental\nchanges, as part of environmental strategies, plans, programmes, budgets. At the international\nlevel, the OECD set of “key environmental indicators” has been adopted by Environment\nMinisters.\nWhen reviewed from the perspective of assessing the contribution of environmental\nconditions to QoL, however, existing indicators remain limited in important respects: for\nexample, emissions indicators mainly refer to the aggregate quantities of various pollutants,\nrather than to the share of people exposed to them. From a QoL perspective, existing\nindicators should be supplemented by regular monitoring of: i) the number of premature\ndeaths from exposure to air pollution, in particular from particulate pollution; ii) the share of\nthe population lacking access to water services, in particular water supply and sanitation; iii)\nthe share of the population without access to nature, with a focus on daily proximity and\nappropriate mapping; iv) the share of the population exposed to daytime noise above 65dBA\nlevels68, in particular noise in dwellings, to be collected through appropriate surveys and\nmapping; v) information on the damage (both insured and non-insured) incurred due to\nenvironmental disasters, such as floods and droughts; vi) measures and assessment tools for\nemerging environmental issues (e.g. endocrine disruptors, pesticides, non-ionizing\nelectromagnetic radiation) and their longer-term effects on QoL (e.g. from hazardous\nsubstances, climate change, biodiversity degradation, resource depletion); vii) methods for\nvaluing people’s environmental choices (e.g. hedonic prices, valuation of externalities and of\nthe services provided by ecosystems) and for supporting economic decisions related to the\nenvironment and QoL (costs of inaction, environment-related jobs; energy and material\nintensities); and finally, viii) surveys of people’s own feelings and evaluations of the\nenvironmental conditions of their country and neighbourhood.69 As many of the effects of\nenvironmental conditions on QoL differ across various groups of people, these indicators\nshould (when possible) refer to people grouped according to various classification criteria.\n67.\nSuitable survey questions are being implemented both in Europe (e.g. Eurobarometer) and worldwide (e.g.\nthe Gallup World Poll).\n68.\nAn average noise level of 65dBA (over a day time period, e.g. 6.00am-8.00pm in dwellings) is considered to\nbe unacceptable (e.g. by EU legislation), while 55 dBA is considered to be a comfort level.\n\n194\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nA final issue that deserves to be raised is aggregation. In recent years, the call for more\nintegrative environmental indices has become louder, and some non-governmental\norganizations and official institutions have promoted various aggregated indices (see Chapter\n3). However, reservations continue to be voiced about the limits of these indices, their\nperceived opacity, their methodological shortcomings, and the potential for misinterpretation\nand misuse. Although the drive to develop more integrated measures of environmental\nconditions is not a substitute for the type of physical indicators mentioned above, the\ncontinuing pressure for more parsimonious aggregate indices points to the importance of\nsetting some kind of industry standard or quality label, and for greater guidance on the\ninterpretation of these indices.\nInsecurity\nInsecurity is a source of fears and anxieties that negatively affects the quality of\nlife of the people concerned. Insecurity also implies uncertainty about the future,\nwhich decreases QoL for risk-averse individuals. Because of these considerations, a\nlong tradition of research has aimed at measuring “insecurity” (or safety and\nvulnerability) and to assess its effect on well-being. For the purpose of devising\nsuitable approaches to its measurement, it may be helpful to distinguish between\npersonal and economic insecurity.70\nPersonal insecurity\nPersonal insecurity includes those external factors that put at risk people’s physical\nintegrity. The most obvious of these factors are crimes and accidents. While these external\nfactors, in their most severe manifestations, can lead to the death of the person involved, in\nless extreme forms they affect a much larger number of people in each country.71\nDeath from external causes accounts for between 4% and 11% of all deaths in any given\nyear in most OECD countries. Among the various types of external causes (based on the\nWHO classification), deaths due to land transport account for 23% of the total, followed by\nthose related to accidental falls (14%) and, further behind, assaults (3%).72 Available statistics\n69.\nLevison (2009) goes in this direction by combining survey data with air quality data to model subjective\nwell-being as a function of the current air quality in the United States. Controlling for county, year, and month\nfixed effects, he finds no happiness responses to local annual pollution averages (suggesting habituation or\nendogeneity), but large happiness responses to local daily fluctuations (controlling for weather and other\ncovariates). See also Luechinger (2009) and Welsch (2006).\n70.\nEnvironmental insecurity is not developed here since this issue is already considered above.\n71.\nFrom this same perspective, the Calvert-Henderson Public Safety Indicators measure those outcomes that\nresult in death or injury. These indicators identify: i) several important features of individual action within the\nprivate sphere that affect the probability of injury; and ii) specific environmental and public life-saving actions\n(beyond individual control) that impact on people’s safety and potential for harm. The indicators included relate to\nvarious causes of death, with special focus on injuries, motor vehicle crashes and accidents due to firearms (http://\nwww.calvert-henderson.com/pubsaf.htm).\n72.\nSuicide, which can be considered an extreme manifestation of mental illness, accounts for the largest\ncomponent of all deaths from external causes (27% on average).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n195\non the causes of death fail to classify a large fraction of all deaths from external causes, and\nthese “unidentified” causes account for around one-third of all such deaths in OECD\ncountries.73 While all of these deaths are captured by mortality statistics, the rationale for\nhaving specific measures of their frequency is that they may have a different emotional effect\non people compared to deaths related to medical conditions. \nBeyond their death toll, threats to personal safety affect QoL even in their less extreme\nmanifestations. The most obvious example is crime. Measures of crime can be derived from a\nvariety of sources (e.g. administrative records and household surveys). While comparisons of\ncrime statistics based on police records are affected by cross-country differences in reporting\npractices, greater comparability is achieved through household surveys specifically designed\nto assess people’s experience with victimization. One such survey is the five-yearly\nInternational Crime Victim Survey (ICVS), which is run by a consortium coordinated by the\nUnited Nations Interregional Criminal Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) and the United\nNation Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).74 Based on this source, around 15% of all\nOECD citizens reported that they or other members of their family experienced one of 10\ntypes of conventional crime in 2005, with large differences across countries (ranging between\nover 20% in Ireland, New Zealand, Iceland and the United Kingdom to less than 10% in\nHungary, Japan and Spain). Among all these types of conventional crime, around one-third\nare contact crimes, while an additional 10% of respondents reported having experienced non-\nconventional crimes such as consumer fraud or corruption. In most OECD countries, the\nfrequency of conventional crime has declined since 2000. \nPersonal insecurity with respect to crime can also be measured through data on people’s\nfears of being a victim of physical aggression. The most remarkable feature of these reports\non subjective fears is how little they seem to be related to measures of experienced\nvictimization. Questions from the same survey about whether people feel unsafe when\nwalking in the street after dark not only show that the share of people fearing crime is\nsignificantly higher than the overall victimization rate, but also that countries where a higher\nshare of people fear crime do not record a higher frequency of victimization (Figure 2.6).\nAlso, within countries, older and richer people feel more unsafe than younger and poorer\npeople, despite being less likely to be victims of crime. Changes in experienced victimization\nand in fears of crime are also weakly related within individual countries, which suggest that\nthe media plays a large role in amplifying concerns and focusing public opinion on specific\ndomains. \n73.\nDeaths from work accidents are not separately identified in OECD statistics on “causes of deaths”. In some\nOECD countries, accidents due to commuting to and from work (which are classified as “fatal work accidents” in\nILO statistics on the subject) account for up to 50% of all deaths from land transport.\n74.\nNational victimization surveys are also conducted in individual countries. For example, in the United States,\nthe National Crime Victimization Survey has collected data on personal and household victimization since 1973,\nwhile in France, a similar survey started in 1996. The data included in victimization surveys generally include the\ntype of crime; time and location of occurrence; relationship between victim and offender; characteristics of the\noffender and of the victim (such as age, race, gender and income); protective actions taken by the victim during the\nincident and results of those actions; consequences of the victimization; type of property lost; whether the crime\nwas reported to the police and reasons for reporting or not reporting; and the offender’s use of weapons. A manual\naimed at increasing comparability between national victimization surveys is currently being finalized under the\nauspices of the Conference of European Statisticians.\n\n196\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nFigure 2.6. Prevalence of victimization and fear of crime in OECD countries, 2005\nPercentage share of respondents\nNote: Victimization is measured as the share of respondents reporting that they (or some other member of their\nfamilies) had been a victim of one of 10 types of conventional crime in the previous 12 months. Fear of crimes\nis based on questions about people feeling unsafe or very unsafe on the street after dark.\nSource: 2005 International Crime Victim Survey and European Survey on Crime and Safety.\nThese patterns highlight the importance of more regular and objective measures of crime\nto orient public discussion. Victimization surveys are an essential tool to assess the frequency\nof crime and the fear it generates, but their practical use is often limited by small sample sizes,\nthe low survey frequency, and the lack of a standardized classification of types of crime. \nVictimization surveys also have other limits: \n• They underestimate domestic violence, especially when the person is interviewed at\nhome in the presence of other household members. Most of this violence is exerted\nagainst women, and contributes to relegating them to the home and denying them\nopportunities for work and leisure: this violence has been identified by the World Health\nOrganization as a major health risk affecting women and children (Box 2.6). \n• Answers to surveys may be affected by cultural traits that vary across countries and\ngroups (as in the case of sexual abuse). \n• Finally, and most importantly, victimization surveys are difficult to design and\nimpossible to conduct in countries ravaged by conflicts and wars. \nOther sources need to be mobilized to measure these threats to personal security.\nAUS\nAUT\nBEL\nCAN\nDEN\nFIN\nFRA\nDEU\nGRC\nHUN\nISL\nIRL\nITA\nJPN\nLUX\nMEX\nNLD\nNZL\nNOR\nPOL\nPOR\nESP\nSWE\nUKG\nUSA\n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\n25.0\n30.0\n35.0\n40.0\n45.0\n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\n25.0\nFears of crime\nVictimisation rate\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n197\nBox 2.6. Marital violence: implications for women’s and children’s health and security\nViolence against women, within and outside the home, in peacetime and during conflict situations, can\ntake many forms. Each can undermine women’s basic capabilities and functionings. But marital violence\nis the most pernicious, not least because it occurs within the family – the institution that is conventionally\nassumed to be driven by altruism and instrumental in enhancing human well-being. Marital violence will\nscar the women who suffer it, the children who witness it, and the men who perpetrate it. It has negative\nconsequences for the well-being of individuals, their families, and the wider society (Agarwal and Panda,\n2007). \nThe World Health Organization has identified marital violence as a major health concern (WHO, 2000,\n2002). Although still largely under-reported, estimates indicate that world-wide between 10% and 50% of\nwomen ever married report having experienced physical violence from spouses (Population Reports,\n1999), with this phenomenon cutting across countries and economic groups. Psychological abuse is even\nmore common. Marital violence is found to cause serious physical and mental injury to women\n(Dannenberg et al., 1995; Harper and Parsons, 1997; Maman et al., 2000). Violence during pregnancy is\nassociated with miscarriages, low birth weight infants, maternal morbidity, and even foetal and maternal\ndeath. Injuries caused by domestic violence can critically undermine a woman’s economic freedom – such\nas her capability to earn a living – by making her fearful of reprisal if she goes out to work, or seeks to\nupgrade her skills, or explores job options. Physical or mental injury can adversely affect her job market\nprospects, productivity, regularity of work life, and chances of upward mobility (Brown et al., 1999; Lloyd\net al., 1999). Marital violence can also erode a woman’s social opportunities by undermining her\nrelationships and social capital. Neighbours and friends tend to shun families where violence is common,\nand a woman’s self-confidence can get so eroded that she withdraws from social contact. The “battered\nwoman syndrome” implies that a woman’s sense of self is so damaged that she begins to believe she\ndeserves the abuse. It also makes her fearful to seek help when she needs it. Marital violence can similarly\nundermine a woman’s political freedom – her ability to be an active citizen or seek her entitlements. \nDomestic violence also carries intergenerational costs, such as foetal damage when the mother faces\nviolence during pregnancy and psychological damage to children witnessing such violence. Children\nwitnessing domestic violence tend to suffer from higher emotional and behavioural problems than other\nchildren and carry the seeds into adulthood (McCloseky et al., 1995; Edleson, 1999). Girls who see their\nmothers being beaten by their fathers are more likely to accept spousal abuse. Boys who see their fathers\nbeat their mothers are more likely to beat their wives. In other words, marital violence undermines the\ncapabilities – physical and mental – of all family members, leading to high human, social and economic\ncosts. The Australian Committee on Violence estimated that the cost of refuge accommodation for victims\nof domestic violence in 1986-87 was US$ 27.6 million (Carrillo 1992). Comprehensive surveys are needed\nto assess the extent and effects of marital violence and its correlates, and to monitor the impact of laws and\npolicies instituted for dealing with it. Women’s ownership of assets, such as housing and land, for instance,\nhas been found in some regions to be linked with a significantly lower incidence of martial violence\n(Agarwal and Panda, 2007), and with higher women’s security (Agarwal, 1994). Freedom from domestic\nviolence needs to be a significant part of any exercise for evaluating the quality of life and for expanding\nhuman capabilities.\nPotential victims can buy protection against the risks of crime, accident, or natural disaster\nfrom insurance companies. In this way, the negative consequences generated by the\nrealization of the risk are partially alleviated. For example, the victims of a non-fatal car\naccident receive a financial compensation for their economic damages (medical bills, lost\nwages) and for their non-economic prejudice (injuries, temporary or permanent disability,\npain, and suffering). When the accident is fatal, the dependents of the victims are entitled to\ncompensation for their loss. In both cases, the victims or their dependents can accept the\nsettlement proposed by the insurance company or can go to trial.\nInternational comparisons of the compensation for a life or a non-fatal injury are difficult,\nas compensation scales are not official. However, some statistics are public. For example, in\n\n198\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nFrance, where insurance companies have to publish the compensation obtained by the victims\nor the dependents, the median compensation for the moral prejudice paid to a husband or wife\nin the event of the death of a spouse is €15,500 (€14,000 for a child and €15,000 for a father\nor mother). These measures are likely to largely under-estimate the consequences following\nthe realization of these various types of risks. Oswald and Powdthavee (2008) report evidence\nof a large impact of bereavement on people’s subjective well-being.\nEconomic insecurity\nThe term “insecurity” encompasses a broader range of risks beyond those that bear on\npersonal insecurity. For example, variations in income over time can be a source of insecurity\nfor the person affected, even when it is healthy for society as a whole (e.g. because it reflects\nhigher social mobility). However, assessing this variability (and how it changes over time)\nrequires surveys that follow the same person over long periods. In the United States, where\nsuch surveys exist, the evidence points to a clear increase in income volatility over time,\nespecially for households at the bottom of the income scal75e. As similar surveys are rare in\nother countries, this section is limited to a few types of “named” risks that can lead to\neconomic insecurity: unemployment, illness, and old age. \nEconomic insecurity may be defined as uncertainty about the material conditions that may\nprevail in the future. This insecurity may generate stress and anxiety in the people concerned,\nand make it harder for families to invest in education and housing. The United Nations’\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights refers to the “right to security in the event of\nunemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other losses of livelihood in\ncircumstances that are beyond the control of each individual”. This “social right” is generally\nenforced through the protections attached to jobs and granted through social policies.\nThe measurement of economic insecurity may follow different paths in terms of what is\nactually measured. Some approaches try to quantify the frequency of specific risks, while\nothers look at the consequences for quality of life when a specific risk materializes, and at the\nmeans available to people to protect themselves from these risks. There have been few\nattempts to combine more comprehensive information about both the frequency and\nconsequences of various risks.\nThe realization of each risk has negative consequences for the quality of life of the person\naffected, depending on the severity of the shock, its duration, the stigma associated with it\n(e.g. being unemployed) and each individual’s risk aversion. Most national statistical systems\nand international organizations provide some measure of the financial consequences of\nunemployment and old age (replacement rates) or illness (out-of-pocket expenses). These\nconsequences, however, also depend on the type of protection available and on its cost,\ndimensions that are rarely considered.\nEconomic insecurity due to unemployment\nJob loss can lead to economic insecurity if unemployment is recurrent or persistent, if the\nreplacement rate is low, or if workers have to accept major cuts in pay, hours or both to find a\n75.\nThe Panel Survey on Income Dynamics, managed by the University of Michigan, has been tracking a\nnationally representative group of households since the late 1960s.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n199\nnew job. Therefore, it is not the loss of a job per se that causes economic insecurity, but rather\nthe frequency and duration of the spells of unemployment and inactivity, and their\nconsequences. \nA useful distinction is that between job instability and job insecurity. The first refers to the\nbreak in the contractual relationship between the worker and the employer, where this\ninterruption can be followed by a new hire with a different firm. The second refers to the case\nof a person remaining jobless for an extended period, with the definition of this length being\npartly conventional and partly based on available information. A possible indicator of job\ninsecurity is the number of workers who are employed at a given date and are inactive (or\nunemployed) one year later (as measured through a Labour Force Survey).76 Based on this\ndefinition, in 2003 job insecurity in France (as measured by the annual transition rate between\nemployment and unemployment or inactivity) was at the same level observed twenty years\nearlier, despite a large increase in job instability (as measured by job turn-over, Cerc, 2005).\nDifferent patterns of job insecurity and instability are also evident across European countries\n(Table 2.2), with some countries combining high job stability and high job security (Belgium,\nItaly, and Portugal), while others feature low job stability and low job security (Germany,\nUnited-Kingdom, Spain, and Ireland), and still others exhibit either high job security and low\njob stability (the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland) or low job security and high job stability\n(France, Austria, and Greece).\nThe financial consequences of job instability encompass both present and future losses of\nincome. The present loss is due to the fact that the replacement income is typically lower than\nthe earnings on the previous job. The extent to which people are protected from the financial\n76.\nThis indicator, however, will miss those workers that have experienced recurrent spells of joblessness during\nthat one-year period.\nTable 2.2. Transition rate from employment to non-employment in European countries\nNote: 5.5% of French workers employed in October 2000 were non-employed in October 2001; 84.8% were\nemployed in the same job. Data refer to workers employed in the private sector in October 2000.\nSource: Cerc (2005), based on data from the European Community Household Panel for 2000 and 2001.\n \nNon-employment \nSame job \nAnother job \nLuxembourg \n2,7 \n91,0 \n6,3 \nBelgium \n2,3 \n86,2 \n11,5 \nItaly \n4,6 \n85,0 \n10,4 \nPortugal \n4,7 \n84,5 \n10,8 \nThe Netherlands \n3,7 \n79,3 \n17,0 \nDenmark \n4,0 \n79,3 \n16,7 \nFinland \n4,4 \n83,5 \n12,2 \nFrance \n5,5 \n84,8 \n9,6 \nAustria \n5,2 \n84,8 \n10,0 \nGreece \n5,7 \n84,6 \n9,7 \nGermany \n7,0 \n80,7 \n12,3 \nUnited-Kingdom \n5,9 \n76,2 \n18,0 \nIreland \n7,6 \n73,8 \n18,6 \nSpain \n8,9 \n70,2 \n20,9 \n\n200\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nimpact of unemployment in the short term depends on four factors: i) the probability of being\nentitled to unemployment insurance; ii) the level of UI benefits relative to previous earnings;\niii) the probability of being eligible for social assistance when not entitled to UI; and iv) the\nlevel of social assistance. While indicators of these financial consequences are available,\ncross-country comparisons are difficult for several reasons (e.g. unemployment benefits can\ndepend on family composition; unemployment and assistance benefits may not be easily\nseparable; the share of people entitled to unemployment benefits may vary with the duration\nof unemployment), requiring special investments in this direction. In the longer term, the\nfinancial consequences of unemployment will include possible losses in wages when the\nindividual eventually finds another job, as in the case of workers whose human capital was\nspecific to a particular firm or industry. The risk aversion of each worker, the discount rate\nused, and insurance costs also influence the size of these longer-term financial losses.\nJob insecurity can also be measured through self-reports of individual workers. Fears of\njob loss can have negative consequences for the quality of life of each worker (e.g. physical\nand mental illness, tension in family life), for firms (e.g. adverse impacts on workers’\nmotivation and productivity, lower identification with corporate objectives) and for society as\na whole (De Witte and Näswall, 2003). Various surveys provide information about perceived\njob insecurity, by asking workers either to evaluate their satisfaction with the security of their\npresent job, or to rate their expectation of job loss with either probabilistic questions (“what\ndo you think is the percent chance that you will lose your job during the next 12 months?”) or\nqualitative questions (“thinking about the next twelve months, how likely do you think it is\nthat you will lose your job or be laid-off?”). Data on satisfaction with job security among\nEuropean countries in the early 2000s show large cross-national differences, with greater fear\nof job losses in southern European countries compared to northern ones (Cerc, 2005)77.\nEconomic insecurity due to illness\nIllness can cause economic insecurity directly, through its medical cost, and indirectly,\nthrough the loss of income due to inability to work. For people with no (or only partial) health\ninsurance, medical costs can be devastating, forcing them to go into debt, to sell their home\nand assets, or to forego treatment at the cost of worse health outcomes in the future. The\nhigher health care costs recorded over the past few decades in some countries have made\nthese risks all the more frequent.\nOne indicator of illness-related economic insecurity is provided by the share of individuals\nwithout health insurance. Almost all Europeans are covered by a basic health insurance plan,\nalthough with differences in the extent of coverage provided for various types of treatment\n(OECD, 2004). In contrast, nearly 47 million Americans (16% the population) were without\nhealth insurance in 2006 (DeNavas-Walt et al., 2007), with an increase of almost 9 million\npeople since 2000.78 Nearly 90 million people – about one-third of the population below the\nage of 65 – spent a portion of either 2006 or 2007 without health coverage. \n77.\nThe data set used is the European Community Household Panel (2001), which asks people to rate their\nsatisfaction on a 4-point scale (unsatisfied, fairly satisfied, satisfied, fully satisfied). Only 10% of Austrians are\n“unsatisfied” versus 48% of Greeks. At the opposite end, the response “fully satisfied” is very frequent in Austria\nand Ireland (37%), while it is rarely chosen in Portugal (4%), France (6%) and Greece (6%).\n78.\nIn the United States, the increase in the number of uninsured people in 2006 was concentrated among people\nof working age, with 1.3 million full-time workers losing their health insurance in that year.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n201\nHowever, this indicator underestimates economic insecurity due to illness, as even insured\npeople generally pay something for their treatment. For example, in 2004, more than 14\nmillion Americans paid more than 25% of their earnings on out-of-pocket medical costs and\nhealth premiums; 10 million of them were insured (Families USA, 2004). Medical costs are a\nfactor in nearly half of all personal bankruptcies in the United States, and 80% of families\nwho go bankrupt for medical reasons have health insurance (Himmelstein et al., 2005). The\nfinancial consequences of illness can be measured by looking at out-of-pocket health\nexpenses. This information is provided by national and international sources, but with low\nfrequency and long delays. To these out-of-pocket health expenses should be added the loss of\nincome that occurs if the person has to stop working and the health insurance does not provide\nreplacement income. \nEconomic insecurity associated with old-age\nOld-age, per se, cannot be considered as a risk, but it still implies a certain degree of\neconomic insecurity due to uncertainty about the needs and resources that will be available\nafter having withdrawn from the labour market. Two types of risk, in particular, can be\nidentified.\n• The first is the risk of falling into poverty in old-age. Most OECD countries have\nachieved a significant shift in the risk of poverty away from the elderly and towards\nyounger people over the past few decades, and this shift is one of the most significant\nachievements of social protection in these countries. But the risk of poverty remains\nimportant in some countries (i.e. those with less mature pension systems) for some\ngroups of elderly people (e.g. women with limited labour-force participation during\ntheir working years), and when combined with other contingencies (such as chronic\nhealth problems and disability in old age). \n• The second is the risk of volatility in future pension payments. While all retirement-\nincome systems are exposed to some risk (e.g. risk of lower pension benefits in pay-as-\nyou-go systems due to changes in demographic conditions), the greater role of the\nprivate sector in financing old-age pensions (in the form of both employer-based\noccupational pensions and of personal pension savings) have allowed extending pension\ncoverage to a larger number of workers, but at the cost of shifting risk from government\nand firms towards individuals, who have less capacity to hedge against these risks and\nwhose degree of risk aversion increases with age. \nThe need to better measure economic insecurity in old-age will be especially critical as the\ncurrent financial crisis unfolds, as many people will be approaching retirement with sharply\nlower annuities from accumulated financial assets, lower (or no) housing values, and a risk of\nlosing their pensions following the default of their employer or their pension funds.\nCombining information on both the frequency and consequences of each type of risk\nA comprehensive measure of insecurity would ideally need to account for both the\nfrequency of each risk and its financial consequences. While developing such comprehensive\nmeasures is a task fraught with difficulties, some attempts in this direction have been made.\nFor example, Osberg and Sharpe (2002) measure the economic insecurity associated with\nunemployment as a function of the probability of becoming unemployed and the extent to\nwhich people are protected from the economic losses that follow unemployment (as estimated\n\n202\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nby gross replacement rates for the unemployed).79 Fleurbaey and Gaulier (2007) propose a\nmore elaborated measure that also integrates risk aversion.80 \nThe idea of combining information about both the frequency of a risk and its financial\nconsequences (i.e. by taking the product of the probability that the risk materializes and the\nchange in well-being that would result from its occurrence) can be generalized beyond\nunemployment to any risk. To be complete, the indicator of the change in well-being should\nintegrate a measure of the cost of protecting oneself against the risk, which is a complex task.\nResearch on these approaches should be further developed, so as to lead to indicators that\ncould inform about both the scale of the various risks in each country and their distribution\nacross the population.\nFactors shaping the consequences of various risks\nPeople may buy protection against the financial consequences of various economic risks\nthrough the accumulation of private assets, or through public or private insurance. Because of\nthe importance of social protection in providing insurance against various types of economic\nrisk, a tradition of research in this field has developed measures of economic insecurity based\non the size and features of social protection systems in various countries (Menahem, 2007). \nWhile comparative research on welfare state outcomes has highlighted a number of\npatterns that are important for assessing QoL for people in each country, these patterns are\nsometimes based on measures of the protection available (typically based on the size of public\nspending for various social programmes), which are limited in a number of respects. \n• First, measures of welfare efforts based on gross public spending ignore the support\nprovided through the tax system, for example by awarding tax advantages that\nencourage people to buy health insurance or private pensions.81\n• Second, public programmes can substitute for a wide range of private arrangements that\nalso provide protection against various economic risks. Some of these private\narrangements also have an element of redistribution towards people in specific\nconditions (such as mandatory sickness payments paid by employers to their\nemployees),82 while others are entirely private (such as investment in housing during\nworking age used to generate income while in retirement). \n79.\nOsberg and Sharpe (2002) argue that this second factor should ideally be measured as the proportion of the\nunemployed claiming unemployment benefits times the percentage of weekly earnings replaced by benefits.\nQuality information about the proportion of the unemployed receiving benefits is, however, lacking. Osberg and\nSharpe also define “insecurity in old age” as the share of elderly people who are poor times the average poverty\ngap for this group.\n80.\nFleurbaey and Gaullier (2007) model the income loss due to the risk of unemployment as a function of the\ndegree of risk aversion, the probability of unemployment (computed from the rate of unemployment and its\naverage duration), and the income loss associated with unemployment.\n81.\nIn the United States, for example, consideration of these various forms of tax support increases public social\nspending by around 1 point of GDP (to a level of net public social spending of 18.6% of GDP in 2003), while in\nFrance the same flows lower it by around 4 points of GDP (to a level of 29.2% of GDP).\n82.\nIn the United States, these mandatory private programmes with an element of redistribution (hence included\nin the OECD definition of “total social spending”) account for 8.4% of GDP, as compared to less than 3% of GDP\nin France.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n203\n• Last, all types of protection against economic insecurity have costs. In the case of public\nprogrammes, the taxes needed to finance them will affect the strategies that individuals\nmay follow to hedge against insecurity. These costs should also be taken into account\nwhen measuring the financial consequences of various types of risk.\nAggregation across different categories of economic risk\nA general problem confronted by all attempts to derive a comprehensive measure for\neconomic insecurity is that of aggregation. While each of these risks can be quantified\naccording to specific indicators, they do not lend themselves to aggregation as they lack a\ncommon metric to assess their severity. Some steps in this direction have, however, been\ntaken.\n• Osberg and Sharpe (2002) scale measures for four main types of economic risk\n(unemployment, illness, single parenthood, old-age) through a “linear scaling\ntechnique”, applied in such a way that, by convention, the increase in each scaled\nvariable represents lower economic insecurity; the four scaled variables are then\naggregated into an overall “economic security index” based on weights that represent\nthe relative importance of four demographic groups in the total population.83\n• Fleurbaey and Gaullier (2007) compare populations that differ in some non-income\ndimension by computing the “equivalent income variation” that would make each\npopulation indifferent between its current situation and a reference situation with\nrespect to the non-income dimension. This equivalent income approach allows\naggregating various risks.\n• Other approaches, such as the Personal Security Index developed by the Canadian\nCouncil on Social Development, aggregate objective measures of various risks\npertaining to both economic security (e.g. risks of losing one’s job and financial\nresources, of disease and injury) and personal security (e.g. risk of crime and theft)\nusing subjective weights based on specific surveys that ask people to rate three types of\nsecurity (economic, health, personal). Such a methodology could be applied to other\ncountries.\nCross-cutting issues\nMost of the challenges involved in providing credible measures of QoL are specific to\neach of the dimensions considered. Some challenges are, however, cross-cutting, and would\nbe missed by further research and data gathering undertaken within each of the dimensions\nconsidered above.84 Three of the most salient challenges are addressed below.\n83.\nThese weights are: i) for unemployment, the share of the population aged 15-64 in the total; ii) for illness, the\nshare of the population at risk of illness (100%); iii) for single parenthood, the share of the population comprised\nby married women with a child under 18; and iv) for old age, the share of the population aged 45-64 in the total.\nThese shares are normalised for all years to sum to unity.\n84.\nWhile insecurity is dealt with as an objective factor shaping quality of life, it can also be considered as a\ncross-cutting issue because of the large variety of risks the individuals are exposed to. The placement of insecurity\namong the objective factors has been debated at some length and is conventional.\n\n204\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nInequalities\nMeasures of QoL typically refer to average conditions in each country for each of the\nspecific domains considered. What these average measures miss are the inequalities in\npeople’s experiences. Accounting for these inequalities is necessary to fill the gap between\ncountry-wide estimates and people’s feelings about their own conditions. Developing such\nindicators would also allow paying special attention to the conditions of people with the\nlowest QoL in terms of each of its various domains.\nWhile established methodologies and data sources allow measuring inequalities in the\ndistribution of economic resources within countries in a fairly reliable way, the situation is\nmuch less satisfactory with respect to non-monetary dimensions of quality of life. This is\nespecially true because inequalities in these non-monetary dimensions cannot always be\ndescribed through information about how these features are distributed around their mean.\nThese difficulties require developing measures of inequalities that are specific to each field.85\nIt is also necessary to assess these inequalities in a comprehensive way, by looking at\ndifferences across individuals, groups and generations. \n• Inequalities among people. Individuals are the unit of analysis for most analyses of QoL\nas – even when people derive their well-being from a larger unit, such as the family or\ncommunity – there may be asymmetries in how resources and opportunities are\ndistributed within these units: the distribution of family chores between men and\nwomen, and differences in expenditure patterns (e.g. in terms of how much is devoted to\nchildren) depending on who within the family controls the financial flows, are examples\nof this general pattern. The most direct way of highlighting these differences in QoL\nacross people is to compare the outcomes for those at the bottom of the QoL scale and\nthose at the top. In the case of education, for example, in 2006 the test scores (in\nscience) of students aged 15 in France were around 146 points higher at the top quarter\nof the achievement scale than at the bottom quarter, a difference equivalent to almost 4\nyears of schooling. These differences in students’ performance can have lasting\nimplications for youth as they move into adult life: poor learning outcomes at the end of\ncompulsory schooling lead to a higher probability of dropping out of school before\ncompleting secondary education, worse earnings and career prospects when entering the\nlabour market, a lower probability of benefiting from on-the job training and a higher\nprobability of poverty in adult life. \n• Inequalities between groups with different individual characteristics. A second way in\nwhich these disparities in QoL outcomes can manifest themselves is among\nhomogeneous groups of the population, e.g. by age, gender, socio-economic status or\nother criteria. These between-group differences are important, as groups help to\nstructure the identity of individuals and to define the ways in which people express their\nvoice and act collectively. Groups can also be a source of inequality when they exclude\npeople from the benefits and guarantees that are available to insiders. While these\n85.\nThis difficulty is best illustrated by the case of health, where attempts to create indices of inequalities that\nparallel those used to describe income inequalities have run into a series of methodological difficulties because of\nthe way various health outcomes are distributed among the population. For example, distributions of mortality\nhave most of their mass in the tails, which makes standard measures of inequality (such as Gini) behave in non-\nstandard ways. Other aspects of QoL, such as voting, can be measured only through dichotomous variables (either\nparticipating in a ballot or not), which make inequality measures conceived for continuous variables unsuitable.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n205\nbetween-group differences manifest themselves in all dimensions of QoL, they are\nespecially important in the case of health. For example, inequalities in average life\nexpectancy between ethnic groups range from 6 ½ years between Afro-American and\nwhite men in the United States to 18 years between aboriginals and others in Australia.\n• Persistence of advantage and disadvantage across generations. In general, most\nrespondents in various OECD countries declare that inequalities are acceptable when\nthey do not trap people in situations of disadvantage that persist from generation to\ngeneration; and yet there is much evidence that a range of QoL outcomes are\ntransmitted from one generation to the next. In particular, the parents’ socio-economic\nconditions are among the most important determinants of their children’s opportunities.\nFor example, babies born to a mother who is malnourished and in poor-health have a\nhigher probability of being underweight and of experiencing poor health in adulthood.\nSimilarly, the socio-economic status of parents is among the most important\ndeterminants of children’s educational results. \nSome of these inequalities (such as those related to class and socio-economic status) have\nled, over the years, to a wide array of policies and institutions aimed at reducing their\nintensity and consequences. Others types of inequality, such as between ethnic groups, are\nmore recent (at least in countries that have experienced large waves of immigration) and are\nset to become politically more salient in the future as immigration continues. \nThis discussion points to two main conclusions. The first is that there are as many\ninequalities as there are features of QoL described above. Each of these inequalities is\nsignificant in itself, which underscores the importance of avoiding the presumption that one\nof them will always encompass all the others. The second conclusion is that, because of the\nlinks among the dimensions described above, various types of inequalities may strengthen\neach other. Gender disparities, for example, while pervasive in most countries and groups, are\ntypically much larger for households with lower socio-economic status: their combined effect\nis often to exclude young women from poor households from attending school and getting\nrewarding jobs, denying them possibilities for self-expression and political voice, and\nexposing them to hazards that put their health at risk. It is critical that these inequalities be\nassessed in a comprehensive way, by looking at differences in quality of life across people,\ngroups and generations. Further, as people can be classified according to different criteria,\neach with some relevance for people’s lives, inequalities should be measured and documented\nfor a plurality of groups. Appropriate surveys should be developed to assess the\ncomplementarities between the various types of inequalities and to identify their underlying\ncauses. It is up to the statistical community to regularly feed these analyses with suitable data.\nLinks between dimensions\nMeasuring QoL in one dimension at a time, however unavoidable that may be given\npeople’s expertise and specializations, runs into substantive problems. These can be\nillustrated by looking at the relation between health, on the one hand, and income, on the\nother. Taking them separately runs into two problems: \n• The first, conceptual, is that income and health are not separable in any reasonable\nformulation of human well-being: because of this, measuring QoL in one space at a time\nignores the interrelations between them, and will lead to incorrect judgments. Broome\n(2002), for example, argues that people’s lives consist of a set of activities that require\n\n206\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nboth commodities (e.g. income) and health (in the same way as the act of reading\nrequires both the eye and the brain). This argues against the parsing of QoL into\nadditive components such as health, education and income.\n• The second, empirical, is that measuring QoL by looking at one feature at a time misses\nthe double disadvantage of those who are, simultaneously, sick and poor, as well as the\ndouble advantage of those who are, simultaneously, healthy and rich. For example, the\nstandard argument of economists about “Pareto improvements” (i.e. the notion that\nimproving the situation of one person, without hurting that of any other, is an\nunambiguous gain for society as a whole) is powerful and convincing in many\nsituations, but it goes badly wrong when it is applied to one component of QoL while\nignoring others. Making the rich even richer in terms of income may be regarded as a\nPareto improvement when the income of the poor is unchanged, but this ignores the\npotentially negative effects of greater income inequalities on the health of the poor – as\nin the case where the rich become uninterested in supporting universal health care – or\non their participation to the political process – as in the case where rich people gain\ngreater political influence. These are real concerns, and casting Pareto arguments in\nterms of income alone at best misses them, while at worst it rules them out of order. \nBoth arguments point in favour of taking a more “holistic” approach to QoL, where links\nbetween dimensions are systematically assessed. Examples of such inter-relations among\nQoL dimensions abound. For example, the consequences for subjective well-being of being\nboth poor and sick far exceed the sum of the two effects. Much research is currently devoted\nto disentangling these relations between different dimensions of QoL, and in distinguishing\nbetween associations and causality. The scope for progress, however, is hampered by lack of\ninformation on how the main dimensions of QoL are “jointly distributed” across people. In\npractice, most existing surveys do not allow considering these links, as measurement in one\narea is typically performed within the remit of existing disciplinary boundaries. \nThe most obvious way of estimating the joint distribution of the various attributes of QoL\nwould be through a survey in which comprehensive data on all dimensions of QoL were\ncollected for the same sample of people. A less ambitious (but sub-optimal) technique would\nconsist in using different samples for different dimensions, but with enough variables\ncommon to the various surveys to allow estimating the joint distribution. This could be\nachieved by including questions that allow classifying respondents by socio-economic status,\neducation, ethnicity or migrant status within the surveys used in specialized domains.\nWhatever technique is used, developing information on the joint distribution of various QoL\ndimensions would constitute real progress.\nThe importance of better assessing the inter-relations between QoL dimensions goes well\nbeyond measurement and extends to policy design. While it may prove impossible to define a\ncomplete ordering that covers all QoL dimensions, in which case no summary index of QoL\nwould be feasible, indicators pertaining to different QoL dimensions (or perhaps a selected\nsubset) should be considered jointly when designing policies in specific fields. This would be\nan improvement in itself, as health, education and various other policies are typically\ndelegated to different agencies, thereby missing their interactions. Moving beyond this “silo\nthinking” in policy making is one of the greatest appeals of the broad notion of QoL.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n207\nAggregation across dimensions\nThe search for an aggregate measure of QoL that combines information across all its\ndimensions is often perceived as the “holy grail” of all efforts to go beyond conventional\neconomic measures. This perspective is, however, both limited and deceptive. Limited,\nbecause establishing a comprehensive measurement system for QoL that is capable of\nproducing high-quality information in its various fields is a task which is more difficult and\nlonger-term than that of combining the available information in a single summary measure.\nDeceptive, as aggregating the various aspects of QoL cannot be accomplished without value\njudgments that are necessarily controversial: the point already illustrated with regard to\n“combined” measures of health status has a more general validity.\nDespite this, the challenge of providing a more parsimonious description of QoL than the\none provided by scores of non-monetary indicators is real. According to one view, only sub-\ndomain indicators should be produced, leaving it to users to form their opinion about QoL.\nOthers argue that a synthetic indicator has unique political clout, and cite the influence of\nGDP as proof that such indices are essential. Each stance has its strong and weak points. On\nthe one hand, leaving it to users to make the synthesis supposes that users (the media,\npoliticians, the general public) are equipped to do this consistently, which is sometimes\ndubious: the most likely consequences of producing only sub-domain indicators could well be\nthat GDP will remain the dominant indicator, and that statistics produced with no concern for\na synthesis will fail to supply appropriate data. On the other hand, the search for a synthetic\nindicator risks embroiling statistical institutions in political debates that put their neutrality at\nrisk.\nVarious methods of aggregation across QoL dimensions exist, and they relate to the\napproaches described earlier in this chapter. These methods can be described as providing\nanswers to different questions, such as the ones detailed below. These questions and answers\nclosely map into the theoretical approaches to QoL discussed earlier in this chapter: while the\nfirst and second questions in this list relate to the capability approach, the third and fourth\nquestions relate to the subjective well-being approach, and the last question relates to the\napproach based on the theory of fair allocations:\n1. Is society doing well? Answering this question requires aggregating information on\naverage scores of various indicators across QoL domains.\n2. Are people living well? This question put the emphasis on the conditions of each\nindividual in society. Answering this question requires aggregating indicators of QoL at\nthe individual level, and then summarizing this information at the level of entire\ncountries.\n3 Are people happy in their life? In this question, the emphasis is on people’s hedonic\nexperiences. Answering this question requires aggregating the various hedonic\nexperiences for each person, and then finding a suitable summary for the country as a\nwhole. \n4 Are people satisfied with their lives? This question focuses on evaluative judgments\nmade by individuals over their lives as a whole. Answering this question requires\naggregating measures of satisfaction across people.\n5 Do people have the quality of life they want? This question retains the individual as the\nfocus of analysis, and requires information on how much they would be willing to\n\n208\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nsacrifice in one dimension of their QoL in order to obtain some reference level in other\ndimensions. One approach to answering this question relies on the concept of\n“equivalent income”.\nThese are separate questions, and which of them is most relevant depends on the context\nand on ethical choices between the various approaches. Because they are all related to\napproaches that are defended and considered legitimate by respectable contributors to the\ndebate about social progress, one way out of the dilemma of proposing a single summary\nmeasure of QoL is that statistical institutions construct several synthetic indicators,\nresponding to the different questions above. This would preserve their neutrality while\nproviding sufficient and consistent data for political debate. A related possibility would be to\nprovide indicators in which some parameters, in particular those reflecting value judgments,\ncan be modified by the users (as already done on some websites that propose alternative\nsynthetic indicators). \nThis next section reviews the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to\naggregation; it omits the life satisfaction method, as this was extensively discussed in a\npreceding section of this chapter. \nAggregating averages across domains\nThe first method of aggregation is based on the idea of deriving a single composite index\nby combining indicators of the average conditions of each country in several domains. This\nmethod is related to the capability approach but also, more broadly, to the social indicator\nmovement. 86 The weights of the various components of this composite indicator can be\nchosen based on a perfectionist approach that considers the various aspects of life as having\nan objective importance, or based on a more subjective approach that takes account of some\ntypical or average preferences of the population. Researchers working with this latter\nperspective often advocate participatory procedures for identifying the domains that matter\nmore and for weighting across them.\nThe main advantage of this method of aggregation is its simplicity, and its small data\nrequirements. Indicators like the UNPD’s Human Development Index have attracted huge\nmedia attention, and generated country rankings that depart significantly from those based on\nconventional economic measures. Most applications of this approach rely on objective data\nfor various domains, but they could easily be extended to incorporate subjective well-being as\none domain. Because of the simplicity of this approach, it is easily communicated and\nunderstood by the general public, and many grass-root movements have favoured various\napplications of this approach. Nevertheless, this approach has a number of limits:\n• The first limit is that, by retaining the notion of a “representative agent”, it cannot track\nthe accumulation of disadvantages by certain subgroups. The combined index will not\nimprove if the correlation of inequalities across domains falls while average\nperformance in each domain remains the same. In practice these composite indicators\ntry to compensate for this limit by including measures of inequality or poverty as a\n86.\nThe social indicator movement was particularly active in the 1960s and 1970s. Key contributions from this\nresearch are gathered in the journal, Social Indicators Research, founded in 1974, which publishes research\ndealing with measurement of the quality of life.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n209\nspecific component. However, this does not overcome the methodological problem of\nneglecting individual conditions. \n• A second limit is related to the choice of weights for various domains. The weights used\nto aggregate averages for various domains are conventional, and even the choice of\nusing unweighted data is a value judgement with important implications. For example,\nthe HDI is a simple average of life expectancy – the ratio life expectancy minus 20,\ndivided by 85 (maximal life expectancy) minus 20 – education – two-thirds of the adult\nliteracy rate plus one-third of the enrolment rate for primary, secondary and tertiary –\nand income (the log of per capita GDP minus the log of 100, divided by the log of\n$40,000 minus the log of 100). However, adding the logarithm of GDP to the level of\nlife expectancy implicitly values an additional year of life in each country by its GDP\nper capita (Ravallion, 1997), thus treating an additional year of life expectancy in the\nUS as worth 20 times a year of life expectancy in India and nearly 50 times a year of life\nexpectancy in Tanzania. \n• A third limit has to do with the interpretation of changes in these aggregate indicators.\nFor example, levels of the HDI give a fresh look at the world, since the country-\nrankings it generates are quite different from those based on GDP per capita. However,\nas time passes and the HDI is updated year to year, its movements have tended to be\ndominated by changes in the GDP component, at least for those developed countries\n(such as France and the United States) whose performance in the health and education\ndomains is close to the top (Figure 2.7)87.\n• A final drawback is that this approach does not allow for a diversity of viewpoints about\nthe relative importance of various dimensions of QoL. A single set of weights is applied\nto the whole society, independently of the heterogeneity of people’s attitudes towards\nincome, leisure, health, education, etc. While, in principle, different weights could be\nused for different countries, this would make the choice of weights even more delicate\nand effectively prevent any comparisons across countries.\n87.\nHowever, when extended to the full range of countries at different levels of economic development, the\ncorrelation between GDP growth and changes in the HDI over the period 1990-2006 is only 0.44. In particular,\nsome poor countries, such as Egypt, Tunisia and Bangladesh, have recorded significant improvements in their HDI\nwith only moderate economic growth, while others have experienced significant economic growth and seen their\nHDI drop. This highlights the fact that, over reasonably long time periods, GDP growth can correlate poorly with\nchanges in the non-income dimensions of well-being.\n\n210\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nDespite these limits, the websites of most statistical institutes and international\norganizations already provide scores of average indicators for various domains of QoL. These\nwebsites could then also provide options to users (in terms of the scaling of the domain\nindices and the choice of their weights) for constructing composite measures based on\naggregating average measures for domains. Some of these options could be earmarked as\nhaving been chosen by authors or institutions, but the official websites would make clear that\nthe institutes are not “endorsing” the indices and the corresponding weights. This solution is\ntechnically easy to implement, with the only hard choice being the choice of domains and\nindividual indicators.\nAggregating indicators at the individual level \nThe second method aggregates over various QoL dimensions at the level of each person,\nand then computes a mean (or a similar summary measure) over all people in the sample for\neach country. This approach, for example, would allow combining a measure of income,\nhealth and education for each person, before computing measures of “average” QoL of the\nentire population. The ethical foundations of this approach are similar to those for the\nindicator based on aggregating averages across domains, but it treats the person as the unit of\nmoral concern. This, in turn, allows recording the correlations across sub-domains. While this\napproach is most commonly applied to objective dimensions, it can be extended to include\nsubjective aspects of QoL as well.\nThis approach is already used to construct measures of multidimensional poverty, i.e.\nmeasures that count people who are deprived in several dimensions. The same approach can\nbe extended to QoL based on a “top sufficiency” cut-off, which would consider a person as\nhaving sufficient QoL if he or she achieves sufficiency in some range of dimensions (Alkire,\n2008). While this type of measure is generally computed with respect to people having\nFigure 2.7. Trends in the HDI and in GDP per capita in France and the United States\nValues of the HDI as reported in the UNDP Human Development Report 2007-2008. Trends in the GDP series are\nbased on OECD values of GDP per capita at constant prices, based on the same transformation underlying the HDI\ncalculation (e.g. the difference between the natural logarithm of GDP per capita in a given year and the log of 100\nUSD, divided by the difference between the log of 40000 USD and the log of 100).\nSource: OECD and UNDP data.\n0.80\n0.85\n0.90\n0.95\n1.00\n1.05\n1975 1980\n1985 1990 1995\n2000 2005\nFrance\nHDI \nGDP \n0.80\n0.85\n0.90\n0.95\n1.00\n1.05\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005\nUnited States\nHDI \nGDP \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n211\ninsufficient achievements, it could be converted to represent QoL by subtracting the\ninsufficiency achievements from 100%.\nThis approach shares the strengths of the previous one (i.e. it relies on objective data and it\nis simple to compute) but also represents a big improvement relative to a composite index\nbased on average indicators by domain. It has, however, been little used in practice, as it\nrequires information on the “joint” distribution of various attributes across individuals.\nBeyond this difficulty, however, this approach shares similar weaknesses with the approach\nbased on aggregating average indicators by domain. \n• The first limit is that of choosing the weights for the construction of an individual index\nof QoL. One path often used in studies of multidimensional poverty is that of counting\nthe number of items in which the QoL of an individual is below a cut-off level, and then\nconsidering the sum of these items. This sum, in turn, can be based on either\nunweighted items (i.e. all have the same importance) or on weighting them based on the\nstatistical properties of the sample (for example, with greater weight attributed to\ndeprivations in those items that are most common in each country). Such weights,\nhowever, carry no ethical authority. While different schools of thought have suggested\ndifferent approaches to setting weights within this approach, they all ignore the\ndiversity of preferences in the population.88 \n• A second limit is that most indices based on this approach focus on people at the bottom\nof the QoL scale, rather than on the entire distribution. These approaches then rely on\n(arbitrary) cut-offs that are used to classify people in terms of dichotomous variables\n(poor or not-poor), which are then aggregated at the individual level. While the focus on\nthose in the lower part of the QoL scale may be justified for policy purposes, it is not\nideal in other respects, as inequalities in QoL, rather than insufficient achievements,\nmay matter per se. To develop aggregate measures of QoL that are informative about\nthe entire distribution would require developing scales that can be compared across\ndomains.\nAggregation based on people’s hedonic experiences\nBeyond people’s own evaluations of their lives as a whole, which – as argued above – may\nbe regarded as an aggregate indicator of a certain sort, approaches to subjective well-being\nbased on hedonic experiences suggest a different path to aggregating across some of the\nfactors that shape QoL. While this approach may still be considered as putting a domain –\nhedonic experiences – at the forefront, it may also be regarded as providing a way of\nweighting different experiences through a common yardstick: the intensity of the hedonic\nexperiences that they generate.\n88.\nRawls (1982) suggests that weights should reflect the typical (“representative”) preferences of individuals\nfrom the worst-off group. Sen (1985, 1992) suggests seeking a partial ranking of individual situations based on a\nconsensus between conflicting preferences. Sen also notes that, whatever one’s views about the relative\nimportance of the various QoL domains, being better-off in each domain should imply being better-off overall.\nThis “dominance” principle, however, would also imply that individual attitudes about the importance of the\ndifferent domains play no role in interpersonal comparisons: for example, the dominance principle would consider\nJones as better off than Smith if the two have the same low level of health but the former is slightly richer than the\nlatter – even if Jones may care much more than Smith about being deprived in health.\n\n212\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nMeasures of the flow of hedonic experiences are intimately connected to the use of time.\nExperiences occur over time, and time use is an objective feature of experience. Moreover,\npositive and negative affect are systematically related to different uses of time. Time is the\nultimate finite resource for people and society, and traditional GDP measures do not reflect\nthe quantity of individuals’ non-work time – indeed, an increase in leisure time will generally\nlower GDP, despite its positive contribution to QoL. Moreover, attempts to value leisure time\nin GDP reflect only the marginal valuation of leisure time, while major changes in society that\ninfluence the amount and use of leisure time cannot be valued in this perspective. \nThe U-index is one way of blending objective and subjective measures of how people\nspend and experience their time. This index measures the proportion of one’s time in which\nthe strongest feeling is a negative one (Kahneman and Krueger, 2006). Positive feelings\ninclude happiness and enjoyment while negative feelings include feeling frustrated,\ndepressed, hassled, angry, worried, or criticized. More precisely, using the Day\nReconstruction Method – in which respondents describe particular episodes in their daily\nexperience – an episode is classified as unpleasant if the most intense feeling reported for that\nepisode is a negative one, i.e. if the highest rating on any of the negative affects is strictly\ngreater than the maximum rating of any of the positive affects. \nWhile the U-index shares some of the weaknesses described earlier with respect to all\nsubjective measures of well-being, it has properties that make it attractive from the\nperspective of measuring QoL:\n• First, it addresses the issue of non-comparability in the use of scales by different people.\nTo the extent that interpersonal differences in the interpretation of scales apply equally\nto positive and negative emotions (e.g. people who report a more positive evaluation of\nsome states will also provide less negative evaluations of other states), then the U-index\nwill be robust to some barriers to interpersonal and international comparisons. In this\nsense, the U-index provides an ordinal measure at the level of feelings. \n• Second, the U-index naturally focuses attention on the most miserable in society, in the\nsame way as the conventional poverty rate does with respect to income. Evidence from\navailable experimental measures of this type does suggest that a very large share of the\nnegative feelings in society is experienced by a small number of people.89\nThe experimental measures of the U-index that are currently available (limited to specific\ncities and demographic groups) highlight significant differences across countries, with a\nranking that differs significantly from the one obtained based on GDP per capita (Figure 2.8)\nor life satisfaction.90 Implementing this measure at the national level would require collecting\ndata on “evaluated” time use, i.e. adding questions about emotional experience during\nspecific episodes in ongoing time-use surveys. Steps in this direction are envisaged in some\nOECD countries (e.g. the United States) and could be generalized to others (e.g. in the context\nof the next collection of time-use data for European countries).\n89.\nAn alternative approach to aggregation based on people’s hedonic experiences would be to measure the\nproportion of one’s time in which the strongest feeling is a positive one. This approach, however, would focus\nattention on the most fortunate in society.\n90.\nBlanchflower (2008) argues, however, that the structure of U-index equations is fairly similar to those based\non life-evaluations.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n213\nAggregation by the equivalence approach\nWhile various indexing methods pertaining to the equivalence approach exist, one that is\neasily applied is based on the notion of equivalent income, i.e. the income that would make\neach person indifferent between their current situation and a situation based on their current\nincome and some reference levels for the non-monetary dimensions of QoL.91 \nThe main strengths of this method are the following: \n• First, it partly avoids the “hedonic treadmill” and the “aspiration treadmill” problems,\ni.e. the risk of underestimating the disadvantages of deprived individuals who adapt to\ntheir situation and report high life evaluations and hedonic experiences. As this method\nonly relies on the ordinal rankings of situations defined by individual preferences, it\ndoes not consider that people are better-off when they obtain high satisfaction by\nlowering their aspirations.92 They are declared well-off only when they obtain what\nthey want.\nSecond, it satisfies the property that, if two individuals have the same preferences in life\nand agree about which of them is better-off, the method will lead to the same ranking.93 The\nFigure 2.8. Measures of the U-index in three cities\nNote: Estimates for the U-index refer to women aged 18-68 who are not full-time students in the three cities of\nColumbus, Ohio (United States), Rennes (France) and Odense (Denmark), as provided by Alan Krueger. The U-\nindex is the proportion of time that the maximum rating of being tense, depressed, or angry exceeds the rating of\nbeing happy. Measures of GDP per capita in 2008 are OECD estimates.\n91.\nTo illustrate, imagine that Jones, with income of €20,000 and reduced mobility, would consider himself\nequally well-off with good health and an income of €15,000. Taking good health as the reference for health,\n€15,000 is his equivalent income. So Jones is considered worse off than Smith who is healthy and whose income is\n€17,000. \n92.\nThis method, however, does not correct the evaluation when the direction of individual preferences is shaped\nby adaptation (for instance, when individuals come to like cheap but unhealthy food). Correcting for this problem\nwould require some kind of paternalistic definition of what is good for people.\n93.\nTo illustrate, suppose that Jones and Smith above have identical preferences and therefore agree that Jones is\nworse off, because they consider that his reduced mobility is worth more than his extra €3,000 income. In this\nsituation, Jones is considered worse-off because his equivalent income is lower.\n0\n10 000\n20 000\n30 000\n40 000\n50 000\n0.0%\n5.0%\n10.0%\n15.0%\n20.0%\nUnited States\nFrance\nDenmark\nU‐index\nGross national income per capita\n\n214\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nidea of respecting individual preferences is usually limited in welfare economics to the\nrespect of preferences in one’s own life, but it seems sensible also to respect interpersonal\ncomparisons when they are based on common preferences. \nThis approach, however, also has weaknesses:\n• First, it requires that people have well-defined preferences about the various aspects of\nlife. In practice, this condition does not always apply, as inconsistency and instability\nplague the choices of people in the real world. In these conditions, this approach\nrequires that people have some consistent values at a deeper level, although these may\nbe hard to observe.\n• Second, the choice of reference values for the non-monetary dimensions of QoL opens\nmany possibilities and involves difficult ethical choices. As this choice may not always\nbe consensual (although it may be for some dimensions such as health), it is one area\nwhere users could be left some choice.\nIt should be noted that the equivalent income should not be interpreted as giving a special\nvalue to money over other aspects of life. The weights given to non-monetary aspects of QoL\nreflect individual preferences. For instance, if people give great importance to health in their\nlife, this will give a great weight to health in the computation of their own equivalent income.\nIn other terms, the incorporation of non-monetary aspects of QoL in this measure does not\nrequire a non-monetary unit of measurement.\nAssuming that people have consistent and stable preferences, these can be retrieved from\nthree sources: observed choices94; stated preference surveys (e.g. contingent valuation\nsurveys95 or discrete choice experiments); and satisfaction surveys (if it is possible to filter\nthe adaptation phenomenon). These techniques are standard in economics, and have in some\ncases been applied to compute equivalent incomes.96 If one does not trust individuals’\nimmediate preferences and seeks to track their deeper preferences, a more refined\nmethodology might be needed, and this has not yet been developed.\n94.\nRevealed preferences are fruitful only for aspects of life that can be traded off by individuals and cannot be\nused to estimate preferences about aspects that are imposed by circumstances.\n95.\nContingent valuation surveys have been criticized for being unreliable when individuals are asked how much\nthey would be willing to contribute to more or less remote aspects of the environment (see in particular Kahneman\net al., 1999; and Diamond and Hausman, 1994). As far as the equivalent income is concerned, the questions would\nbe directly about their own situation, which may partly alleviate some of these problems. Fleurbaey et al. (2009a)\nhave asked respondents what sacrifice in their consumption they would have accepted over the last 12 months if\nthey could have avoided the health problems they endured during the same period, and their results indicate that\nthis willingness-to-pay increases with income and with the severity of health problems. But there is also\nsubstantial evidence of the systematic biases that you get in asking people to value their health, as reviewed by\nDolan and Kahneman, 2008. \n96.\nMuellbauer (1974a,b) and King (1983) have computed money-metric utilities on the basis of household\ndemand data. Browning et al. (2006) use similar data to compute individual equivalent incomes that correct for\nhousehold composition (i.e. they estimate what income would be sufficient for an individual to reach his current\nindifference set on consumption, if he were single). Fleurbaey et al. (2009b) rely on a satisfaction survey to\ncompute equivalent incomes in Russia by correcting for various aspects of QoL such as health, housing,\nunemployment and wage arrears. Fleurbaey and Gaullier (2007) present aggregate estimates of equivalent incomes\n(taking account of hours worked, longevity, unemployment, household composition) and show that the ranking of\nOECD countries is significantly different compared to the one based on GDP per capita.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n215\nDespite these difficulties, experimental applications of this equivalent income approach\nprovide insights into the characteristics of the worse-off in society that differ from those based\non other approaches. Figure 2.9 shows the average characteristics of people classified as\n“worse-off” (i.e. in the bottom quintile of the distribution) based on three measures of their\nquality of life (household expenditure per consumption unit, reported life-evaluations, and an\nestimate of their equivalent income, where the weights applied to various non-monetary\ndimensions are estimated from an equation referring to people’s life-satisfaction) in a sample\nof Russian respondents. People in the bottom quintile of the distribution of equivalent income\nreport lower expenditure, health and housing quality and a higher incidence of unemployment\ncompared to people in the bottom quintile of life-satisfaction. In other terms, the equivalent\nincome approach seems to identify a sub-population that cumulates disadvantages in many\nmore dimensions of their lives compared to approaches that rely on either monetary\nexpenditure or life-evaluations (Fleurbaey et al., 2009). \nFigure 2.9. Characteristics of the most deprived people according to different measures of \nquality of life,  Russia in 2000\nNote. Data refer to people considered as “worse-off” (i.e. in the bottom quintile of the distribution) according to three\ndifferent measures of their quality of life: i) household expenditure per consumption unit (i.e. a standard measure of\nliving standard); ii) life-satisfaction (based on the question “To what extent are you satisfied with your life in general at\nthe present time?” with answers on a five-point scale); and iii) a measure of equivalent income, based on four\n“functionings”, i.e. self-reported health, employment status, quality of housing, and having incurred wage arrears. For\neach of these three measures of quality of life, the figure plots the average levels of various factors shaping quality of\nlife among the “worse-off” based on one measure, relative to its average level across the three measures. Estimates of\nthe equivalent income of people in the sample are based on preferences estimated from an equation on the determinants\nof life-satisfaction. Reference values for the various non-monetary dimensions correspond to “good health”, “not being\nunemployed”, “not having wage arrears”, and “having a median value of housing quality”.\nSource: Fleurbaey at al.

Despite these differences, research in these various\napproaches appears to have progressed sufficiently to make them worthy of measurement by\ngovernment statistical agencies. Developing more systematic data about the various features\nof the QoL holds the promise of improving policy-making and delivering a more\ncomprehensive description of the progress of societies.\nKey messages and recommendations\nThe argument in this report can be summarized through the following points:\n• Quality of life includes the full range of factors that make life worth living, including\nthose that are not traded in markets and not captured by monetary measures. While\nsome extensions of economic accounting allow including some additional elements that\nshape quality of life in conventional money-based measures of economic well-being,\nthere are limits to the extent to which this can be achieved. Non-monetary indicators\nhave an important role to play in measuring social progress, and recent advances in\nresearch have led to new and credible measures for at least some aspects of quality of\nlife. These measures, while not replacing conventional economic indicators, provide an\nopportunity to enrich policy discussion and to inform people’s view of the conditions of\nthe communities where they live; today, they have the potential to move from research\nto standard statistical practice.\n• Recent research has shown that it is possible to collect meaningful and reliable data on\nsubjective well-being. Subjective well-being encompasses three different aspects:\ncognitive evaluations of one’s life, positive emotions (joy, pride), and negative ones\n(pain, worry, anger). While these different aspects of subjective well-being have\ndifferent determinants, in all cases these determinants go well beyond people’s income\nand material conditions. For example, all these measures agree in highlighting that\nunemployment has major damaging effects on the subjective well-being of individuals\nand nations. All these aspects of subjective well-being should be measured separately,\nto derive a more comprehensive measure of people’s quality of life and to allow a better\nunderstanding of its determinants (including people’s objective conditions). National\nstatistical agencies should incorporate questions on subjective well-being in their\nstandard surveys to capture people’s life evaluations, hedonic experiences and life\npriorities.\n• Quality of life also depends on the objective conditions and opportunities available to\npeople. These “capabilities” are considered by some analysts to matter more than just\nthrough their effects on people’s subjective states, and should be seen rather as basic\nconditions of people’s autonomy. How societies are organized makes a difference to\npeople’s lives, as can be seen in measures of people’s heath and education; their daily\nwork and leisure activities; citizens’ political voice and the responsiveness of\ninstitutions; people’s social connections and their environmental conditions; and the\nphysical and economic insecurity that shapes their lives. The challenge in these fields is\nto improve upon what has been achieved already, to develop recognized statistical\nstandards in various fields, and to invest in statistical capacity in areas where available\nindicators remain deficient (e.g. insecurity). This is particularly the case for data on how\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n217\npeople spend their time (and on their enjoyment in performing these activities):\ndeveloping such data at regular intervals and based on standards that allow comparisons\nacross countries and over time is an important priority.\n• Indicators of quality of life should inform about the inequalities in individual\nexperiences. This is important, as social progress depend not only on the average\nconditions in each country but also on the inequalities in people’s conditions.\nAccounting for the diversity of experience (by gender, across groups and generations) is\nnecessary to fill the gap between country-wide estimates and people’s feelings about\ntheir own conditions. Inequality in each of the dimensions of quality of life is significant\nin itself, and this underscores the importance of avoiding the presumption that any\nsingle dimension will always encompass all the others. At the same time, because of the\nlinks between the dimensions of quality of life, various inequalities may also strengthen\neach other. \n• Some of the most important policy questions for quality of life relate to how\ndevelopments in one area affect those in others, and how developments in various fields\nare related to those in income. The consequences for quality of life of having multiple\ndisadvantages far exceed the sum of their individual effects. Developing measures of\nthese cumulative effects requires information on the “joint distribution” of the most\nsalient features of quality of life (such as affect, health, education, political voice)\nacross all people in a country. While the full development of this information could\nprobably be achieved only in the distant future, concrete steps in this direction could be\ntaken by including in all surveys some standard questions that allow classifying\nrespondents based on a limited set of characteristics.\n• The search for a scalar measure of quality of life is often perceived as the most\nimportant challenge for quality-of-life research. While this emphasis is partly (or\nlargely, according to some) misplaced, this report recognizes the strong demand in this\nfield and believes that statistical offices have a role to play in answering it. Several\nscalar measures of quality of life are possible, depending on the question addressed and\nthe approach taken. Some of these measures are already being used (e.g. average levels\nof life-satisfaction for a country as a whole, or composite indices that aggregate\naverages across domains, such as the Human Development Index). Others could be\nimplemented if national statistical systems made the necessary investment to provide\nthe data needed to allow their computation. For example, the U-index, i.e. the\nproportion of one’s time in which the strongest reported feeling is a negative one,\nrequires collecting information on emotional experiences during specific episodes\nthrough existing time-use surveys. Similarly, the approach based on counting the\noccurrences and severity of various objective features of people’s lives requires\ninformation on the joint distribution of these features, while the approach based on the\nnotion of “equivalent income” also requires information on individuals’ preferences\nwith respect to these items. Statistical systems should provide the information needed to\nallow the computation of several aggregate measures of quality of life.\n\n218\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nREFERENCES\nAbraham, K., and C.

The issue is clearly separated from the issue of measuring current well-being whose\nmonetary and non-monetary aspects were the topic of subgroups 1 and 2. \nIn short, the global question we had to look at was to know whether some well-chosen\nstatistics can tell us whether our children or grandchildren will face opportunities at least\nequivalent to the ones that we have had. In doing so, we have to take account of the large\nbody of literature that has been already devoted to this topic. The problem in this field is not\nthe lack of ideas. The problem is rather to understand why it seems so difficult to propose\nsome federative indexes allowing a shared perception of whether our economies are\nsustainable or not. We shall see that there are actually some deep reasons for such difficulties.\nWe shall nevertheless try to examine which routes could be followed to accommodate and/or\nprogressively overcome these difficulties. \nMore precisely, the organization of this technical paper will be the following.\nSection 2 will be devoted to the general review of the state of the art. We shall discuss five\nmain classes of approaches. Section 2.1 will consider Dashboards, i.e. extensive sets of\nindicators gathering information on several aspects of development and its expected\ndurability. In their current versions, these dashboards are extremely rich, and this richness is\ntheir limit. Their complexity does not allow them to compete efficiently with single headline\nindicators such as GDP. Even if the principle of dashboards is to be retained in the end, it is a\nsound objective to try to  keep them as parsimonious as possible. This invites to explore all\nproposals that have been made to push this parsimony at the extreme, i.e. all proposals that\npretend to characterize sustainability with one single number. \nOne first class of such indicators are composite indices reviewed in section 2.2.. The\nproblem of this second class is that these indicators are generally built without any firm\nanalytical framework. Subsection 2.3 will then move on to attempts at integrating\nenvironmental considerations in standard National Accounts. This will consist in shortly\npresenting the System of Eco-Environmental Accounting (SEEA), and in particular the\nconcept of green GDP or green NNP. We shall argue that green GDP, contrarily to some\nexpectations, does not exactly fill the objective of measuring sustainability. It measures at best\nwhat could be produced without endangering environmental sustainability: it does not tell us\nhow far we are below or above such a production level, and it is mute on other aspects of\nsustainability.\nThis leaves us with the last two classes of indicators that seem to be the most serious\ncandidates for a global assessment of sustainability, because they clearly adopt this\n\n234\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nperspective of measuring overconsumption of resources albeit in very different ways.\nSubsection 2.4 will be devoted to the concept of genuine savings or adjusted net savings\n(ANS), popularized in particular by the World Bank. This approach consists in assessing\nsustainability in terms of preservation of a very comprehensive concept of wealth, including\nphysical, human and environmental capital. The other indicator is the ecological footprint\n(EF), that measures how far we live above or below the environmental carrying capacity of\nour territories or of the whole planet. A variant of this indicator, the Carbon Footprint  focuses\non those damages to the environment that matter more specifically for global warming. These\ntwo indicators will be presented in section 2.5. \nFrom this general survey proposed in section 2, it will indeed appear that no indicator\nemerges as consensual, even among those that try to rely on a well-defined concept of global\nsustainability. Such a situation is obviously a source of perplexity for the statistician. Why are\nthere such different views about sustainability? Is there some scope for a larger approach that\nwould subsume all these different views in a comprehensive way? \nThe aim of section 3 of the paper will be to shed more light on this central question. This\nwill be done by restarting from fundamentals. The basic question is to build an indicator that\nwould warn us, sufficiently in advance, whether we are or not on a non-sustainable growth\npath. Some theoretical answers exists to this question that can be viewed as a further\ngeneralization of the concept of adjusted net savings reviewed in section 2.4. Such a\ngeneralization can accommodate many settings: in particular, it is devised to accommodate\nthe cases of efficient as well as inefficient functionnings of markets or institutions –and this\nproperty is of course crucial in the environmental domain-,  or situations where possibilities to\nsubstitute man-made assets to natural ones are strongly limited. \nBut this is no way sufficient to conclude that we have at hand the solution to our problem\nof sustainability measurement. Quite the contrary. This theoretical perspective will rather be\nused to show what are the major obstacles that we face in practical implementations.  The\nmain message from this theoretical presentation will be that, as soon as current prices loose\ntheir informative power, the quantification of sustainability cannot proceed without explicit\npredictions of future economic and environmental trajectories, and without some explicit\nnormative choices about values to be attached to such or such kind of trajectories, i.e. what is\nto be sustained, and for whom. There can be very different views about all of these points.  \nAll these difficulties are particularly important for the environmental component of\nsustainability. This will argue in favor of relatively eclectic final recommendations, mixing\nthe ambition of pursuing efforts for building comprehensive indexes, more focussed on the\neconomic side of sustainability, but accompanied by a set of specific “physical” indexes\nfocussing more specifically on environmental dimensions of sustainability. These tentative\nrecommendations will be exposed in section 4. \nFour appendixes have been added to this technical report. The first one just gives the\nexhaustive contents of one of the large scale dashboards reviewed in section 2.1, the European\nDashbord on Sustainable Development. The three other develop some particular aspects of\nthe ANS or extended wealth approaches to sustainability. Appendix 2 discusses the\nmeasurement of one of the components of this ANS, change in human capital. Appendix 3\npresents some variants of the ANS for France that emphasize the difficulty to get a version of\nthis index that sends strong messages concerning the issue of global warming. Appendix 4\ntries to elaborate further upon this difficulty, looking at connexions with debates that have\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n235\nfollowed the publication of the Stern Report: it shows that the difficulty to get strong\nmessages on climate change based on ANS indicators cannot be an argument in favor of\ninaction. This is one more argument in favor of monitoring this specific issue separately from\nglobal sustainability assessment provided by the either the ANS or some of its extended\nversions. \n \n2. Taking stock\n2.1. Dashboards or sets of indicators\nDashboards or sets of indicators are a widespread approach to the general question of\nsustainable or durable development. They consist in gathering and ordering series of\nindicators that bear direct or indirect relationship to socio-economic progress and its\ndurability. First examples of this approach go back to the 60s and the 70s. At that time, the\nconcept of sustainability did not have the importance that it has gained since and these early\ndashboards were essentially focusing on the measurement of social progress (the so-called\n«social indicators » movement) without any reference to environmental issues. Interest for\nsuch dashboards then declined somewhat, but reincreased strongly since the 1990s. Notably,\nthe Rio Summit in 1992 framed the definition of sustainable development as resting on the\nthree pillars of economic efficiency, social equity and environmental sustainability and led to\nthe adoption of Agenda 21 whose 40th chapter invites signatory countries to develop\nquantitative information on their actions and realizations along these three pillars. As a\nconsequence, the second generation of dashboards that are now available generally devote a\nlarge room to sustainability and environmental issues (see Bovar et al. (2008). \n \nTo be a little more explicit about the typical contents of such dashboards, we have\nreproduced in Appendix table 1 one example of such an extensive dashboard, the European\nDashboard of sustainability indicators. This dashboard covers 10 different themes, with 11\nlevel 1 indicators,  33 indicators for level 2 and 78 indicators at level 3, these level 2 and 3\nindicators covering 29 sub-themes.  The most striking point for an external user is the extreme\nvariety of these indicators. Some are very global ones -GDP growth itself keeps its place, and\nis even the first indicator on the list -, some more specific such as the percentage of smokers\nin the population. Some pertain to outcomes, some other to instruments. Some can easily be\nrelated both to development and sustainability -literacy performance matters both for current\nwell-being and growth prospects- but other ones either pertain only to current development or\nonly to long run sustainability. There are even some items whose link with both dimensions is\ndisputable or at least of indeterminate sign: is a high fertility level a good thing for\nsustainability? Probably yes for the sustainability of pensions, maybe not for environmental\nsustainability. And is it always the signal of good current economic performance? This\nprobably depends upon what we consider as “high” or “low” in terms of fertility? \nThe main criticism to these dashboards is therefore their heterogeneity. One can also be\nworried about the lack or harmonization of these dashboards, the frequent changes that occur\nin their compositions, or the fact that they deliver too much information to be efficient\ncommunication tools, even when their main messages are summed up in a limited set of\nheadline indicators. More fundamentally, these dashboards may appear as lacking a clear\n\n236\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\ndefinition of what is exactly required for sustainability, and even a clear definition of what\nsustainability consists in. The most striking feature in this respect is the apparent confusion\nthat is conveyed by these dashboards between indicators of current levels or trends in well-\nbeing, and on the effective sustainability of these levels and/or trends.   \nIn defense of these dashboard, one may first recall that their hybrid character is in fact\nconsubstantial to the initial Brundtland program of simultaneously caring about development\nand its sustainability. Development can be rapid but non sustainable in the long run.\nSymmetrically, sustainability can be warranted but with very low levels of development. The\noriginality of DD strategies is precisely to orient policy making in directions combining both\naspects, i.e. seeking the highest level of current development that is compatible with long run\nsustainability. In this context, it must come as no surprise to have a cohabitation of indicators\napplying to both domains, even if this is at the expense of readability. \nBox 1: Weak versus strong sustainability\nWeak and strong sustainability are two concurrent concepts that are very frequently used to classify\nempirical approaches to durable development (e.g. Dietz and Neumayer, 2004). \nThe term of weak sustainability has been coined to characterize economic approaches to sustainability\nthat emerged during the 1970s. These approaches were extensions of standard neo-classical growth\ntheories. Standard growth models generally consider that output is only determined by technology and the\navailable quantities of two production factors, labor and capital. The main innovation of this literature has\nbeen to introduce natural resources as an additional production factor in these models, and to specify the\nlaws for the evolution of this natural factor, for instance a modeling of extraction behavior in the case of an\nexhaustible mineral resource - this literature developed after the first oil shock. \nThese models generally assumed large substitution possibilities between natural resources, capital and\nlabor. Combined with exogenous technical progress, this offered one solution to the finiteness of\nresources, at least from a theoretical point of view: as oil resources decline, production is expected to use\nless and less of them but without any decline in standard of living, either thanks to pure technological\nprogress, or by replacing oil by some alternative fossil energy or any other man-made production factor. \nPromoters of strong sustainability rather consider that substitution possibilities necessarily face\nphysical limits. Critical levels must be maintained for most of natural resources. These critical levels must\nbe at least equal to those necessary for basic-life support functions, and more probably higher if we want to\nkeep reasonable levels of environmental resilience, i.e. the capacity of eco-systems to regenerate and\nreturn to equilibrium after shocks. The concept of strong sustainability is often considered as irreducible to\nmonetary approaches. All environmental variables of interest have to be followed in physical terms. \nWe shall follow the tradition to separate these two concepts in most of this text even if, as will be seen\nin section 3, the distinction is in some sense less clearcut than usually said. This is allowed by the fact that\nthe economist’s toolbox also includes representations of production processes where substitution\npossibilities are limited a priori. It is also possible to combine the economic approach with models of eco-\nsystem dynamics to try to put monetary values on features such as resilience or irreversibilities, at least at\nthe theoretical level. The term of inclusive wealth theories is sometimes used for these models that push as\nfar as possible this integration of the economic and environmental viewpoints. Practical applications of\nsuch eco-environmental models remain generally limited to specific eco-systems (see for instance Mäler,\nAniyar and Jansson, 2008 for a series of illustrations) but, to follow the terms of Weber, “if inclusive\nwealth could be computed at the global level, it would constitute a normative indicator combining weak\ndurability (service flows) and strong durability (resilience of ecosystems)” (Weber, 2008, our translation).\n \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n237\nSecond, their development has spurred many efforts to improve the accuracy and\ninternational comparability of existing indicators and it has also spurred many efforts for\nproducing new ones. This movement is an important stimulus to statistical production that, in\nfine, should have positive consequences for all other possible approaches to DD\nmeasurement.\nThird, whatever the implied cost, one must admit that complexity is often unavoidable. It\nis especially the case if we adhere to a principle of “strong” versus “weak” sustainability (see\nbox 1), according to which preserving the well-being of future generations requires\nsimultaneously maintaining critical levels for many environmental assets, rather than a global\ncombination of such assets: this unavoidably implies a parallel follow-up of all these assets.\nEven if we accept weak sustainability, its management generally relies on the combination of\nseveral instruments, each of which needs to be followed separately. And there is no reason\nwhy the detailed lists of all these objectives and instruments should be exactly the same in\nevery place and at any period of time. The requisites of sustainability are inevitably area and\nperiod specific. Made-to-measure dashboards are the right instruments for capturing this\ncomplexity.  Aiming at extreme simplification and at a forced harmonization would mean\nabandoning this comparative advantage of the method.  \nIn short, dashboards are instruments that are useful and cannot be bypassed. At one\nmoment or another, the follow-up of a strategy necessary implies the delivery of quantitative\ninformation both on the instruments of this policy and on how far we are from the realization\nof its targets. Dashboards are inescapable when we come to that phase. Even at a more global\nlevel, the final conclusion of this report will be that we cannot avoid some form of\nmultidimensional view of sustainability. But parsimony remains an objective. If a dashboard\nof sustainability needs to be built, we should try to keep it as small, focussed and structured as\npossible. This requires a good analytical framework of what sustainability means. To this aim,\none can gain in exploring the several efforts that have been devoted to building more\ncomprehensive mono-dimensional sustainability indicators. \n2.2. Composite indexes.\nComposite indexes are one way to circumvent the problem raised by the extreme richness\nof dashboards and to synthesize their abundant and purportedly relevant information into one\nsingle number. Here also initiatives have been numerous (see Afsa et al. (2008) or Gadrey and\nJany-Catrice (2007) for more detailed surveys), with a larger role played by academics and\nnon governmental organizations, while dashboards are usually built with a strong\ninvolvement of official statistical institutes. \nThe general idea of those indexes is to re-scale elementary components in order to ensure\ncomparability and to aggregate them, with possibly unequal weights, to produce one figure.\nAt the simplest level, there exist for instance indexes that try to ‘green’ the Human\nDevelopment Index by combining it with informations on emissions of pollutants (Desai,\n1994 or Lasso de la Vega and Urrutia, 2001). These indexes are among those reviewed for\nFrance by Nourry (2007), with the conclusion that results are difficult to interpret. \nA much more elaborated and relatively well-known index is Osberg and Sharpe’s Index of\nEconomic Well-Being (Osberg and Sharpe, 2002). This IEWB covers simultaneously current\nprosperity (based on measures of consumption), sustainable accumulation, and social topics\n(reduction in inequalities and protection against “social” risks). Environmental issues are\n\n238\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\naddressed by considering the costs of CO2 emissions per capita. Consumption flows and\nwealth accumulation (defined broadly, to include R&D stock, a proxy for human capital, and\nthe costs of CO2 emissions) are evaluated according to National Accounts methodology.\nNormalization of each dimension is handled through linear scaling (nine OECD countries)\nand aggregation relies on equal weights. Among the countries considered, Norway has the\nhighest level of economic well-being, followed by Italy, Germany, Sweden and France. The\nfour Anglo-Saxon countries trail back, with Canada in eighth place and the United States in\nlast place. Jany-Catrice and Kampelmann (2007) revised the Index of Economic Well-Being\n(IEWB) for France with enhanced data over a larger time period. Their results confirmed the\ndivergence between GDP and IEWB since the end of the 1980’s, but largely due to the lack of\nimprovement in reducing inequalities and improving economic insecurity. The “green”\ndimension of this index remains secondary at this stage. \nMore strictly focussed on environmental issues, researchers from Yale and Columbia\napplied the methodology of composite indicators for building both an “Environmental\nSustainability Index” (ESI) and an “Environmental Performance Index” (EPI) (Estes et al.,\n2005). The ESI covers 5 domains: environmental systems (Air, Land, Water, Biodiversity),\nenvironmental stresses reductions (air pollution, waste pressure, natural resource\nmanagement), human vulnerability (exposition of inhabitants to environmental disturbances),\nsocial and institutional capacity (their capacity to foster effective responses to environmental\nchallenges), and Global Stewardship (cooperation with other countries in the management of\ncommon environmental problems). It is 76 variables that are used to cover these 5 domains.\nStandard indicators are for instance indicators of air or water quality (e.g. SO2 emissions per\nhabitant or phosphorus concentration), health related indicators (e.g. infant death rate from\nrespiratory diseases) or environmental governance (Local Agenda 21 initiatives per million\npeople). These 76 indicators are aggregated in 21 intermediate indicators ultimately\naggregated for producing the global ESI, after equal weighting. The EPI is a reduced form of\nthe ESI, based on 16 indicators (outcomes), and is more policy oriented: as such, values are\nscaled according to pre-established policy targets, instead of sample observed data. According\nto such an index, Finland ranked highest in 2005 (global index of 75). The global ranking of\ncountries has some sense, but is often viewed as presenting developed country’s contributions\nto environmental issues in a too optimistic way. The problem also arises between developed\ncountries. For instance, the index shows a very narrow gap between two countries, the US and\nFrance, despite their strong differences in terms of CO2 emissions. In fact, the index\nessentially informs us upon a mix of current environmental quality, of pressure on resources\nand of the intensity of environmental policy, but not about whether a country is on a\nsustainable path or not: no threshold value can be defined on either side of which we would be\nable to say that a country is or is not on a sustainable path.\nGlobally, all these composite indicators should probably be better regarded as invitations\nto look more closely at the various components that lie behind them. This kind of function of\ncomposite indicators has been often put forward as one of their main raisons d’être. A similar\ncomment can be made concerning attempts to synthesize other dashboards with statistical\nprocedures more elaborated that simple weighting, such as principal components analysis\n(Jollands et al. 2003, David, 2008). These approaches are interesting ways to summarize a\ngreat deal of information. Once we have the global view, we can return to detailed elements: a\ncountry that is badly ranked can look at the variables that are predominantly responsible for\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n239\nits situation and try to improve its score along these variables. Such an incentive to policy\nchange is not to be neglected at all. \nBut this is not sufficient to retain them as measures of sustainability stricto sensu that\ncould be placed on the same register as GDP or other accounting concepts. The reason for\ndissatisfaction is twofold. The first is the same as for large dashboards, i.e. the lack of a well-\ndefined notion of what sustainability means. The second is the general criticism that is\nfrequently addressed to composite indicators, i.e. the arbitrary character of procedures that are\nused to weight the various components of the indicator. Such aggregation procedures are\nsometimes presented as superior to the monetary aggregations that are used for building\neconomic indexes, because they are not linked to any form of market valuation. Indeed, and\nwe shall come back on this point several times, there are many reasons why market values\ncannot be trusted when addressing sustainability issues, and more specifically their\nenvironmental component. But monetary or not, an aggregation procedure always means\nputting relative values on the items that are introduced in the index. In the case of composite\nsustainability indexes, we have no notion of what argues in favor of putting such or such\nrelative values on all the different variables that matter for sustainability. The problem is not\nthat these weighting procedures are hidden, non-transparent or non replicable: they are often\nvery explicitly presented by the authors of the indexes –and this is one of the merits of this\nliterature. The problem is rather than their normative implications are seldom made explicit or\njustified.\n2.3. Adjusted GDPs: greening the national accounts \nSubgroup 1 has examined for which reasons  GDP or even total final consumption can be\nonly very partial indicators of welfare. In their seminal paper (1973),  Nordhaus and Tobin\nfollowed this line of criticism and proposed to build a Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW)\nobtained by subtracting from total private consumption a number of components that do not\ncontribute positively to welfare (such as commuting or legal services) and by adding\nmonetary estimates of activities that contribute positively to welfare (such as leisure or work\nat home).\nAdditionally, based upon their MEW, they built a Sustainable Measure of Economic\nWelfare (SMEW) taking into account changes in total wealth. To convert the MEW into the\nSMEW, Nordhaus and Tobin used an estimate of total public and private wealth including\nreproducible capital, non reproducible capital (limited to land and net foreign assets),\neducational capital (based on the cumulated cost of years spent into education by people\nbelonging to the labor force) and health capital, based on a method of permanent inventory.\nThe initial MEW was further enhanced into an Indicator of Sustainability of Economic\nWelfare (ISEW) by Daly and Cobb (1989) and refined by Cobb and Cobb (1994) in order to\nincorporate natural resources, as did also the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)1. Those\nindicators deduce the costs of water, of air and of noise pollutions from consumption and\naccounts mainly for losses of wetlands, farmland, primary forests, and for CO2 damages and\nozone depletion too. \n1.\nThe Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is very similar to the ISEW. It has been promoted since 1995 by the\nnon-governmental organization “redefining progress” (see for instance Talberth, Cobb and Slattery, 2006). \n\n240\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nIn what sense do these adjustments towards a better measure of welfare provide us with\nsomething related to “sustainability”?\nIndeed, since Samuelson (1961) and Weitzman (1976), economic theory has argued that a\ncorrectly adjusted Net National Product should equal the maximum level sustainable –i.e. non\ndeclining- level of consumption that can be reached for today and the future. This is the\n“hicksian” view of income, that defines income as what can be consumed this year without\nbeing poorer at the end of the year, i.e. ending the year with the consumption perspectives\nequivalent to current year consumption. The SMEW and its successors follow this track.\nCloser to our concern here, especially in environmental matters, Hamilton (1996) proposed\nseveral theoretical models, featuring depletion of renewable or non-renewable resources,\npollution or environmental amenities and derived the way final consumption should be\nadjusted for to provide a sound measure of welfare and thus a level of sustainable\nconsumption. Under this theoretical framework, empirical investigations to compute\nenvironmentally-adjusted net domestic product (eaNDP) taking into account the consumption\nof natural capital, often known as “Green GDP”, have flourished since the late 80’s and the\nfirst System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) established in 1993 (see early\nempirical studies by Repetto et al. (1989) or Alfsen et al. (2006) for a survey, and SEEA\nHandbook Chapter 11 (2003) for additional references). \nNevertheless, these accounting adjustments remain rather controversial2. \nOne first problem is that methods of valuation needed for those adjustments are generally\nindirect and often depend to some extent or another on ‘what if’ scenarios. Thus, translating\nvaluations of degradation into adjustments to macro-economic aggregates takes us beyond the\nrealm of ex-post accounting into a much more hypothetical situation. The very speculative\nnature of this sort of accounting explains the great discomfort and strong resistance in this\narea from many accountants.\nMore precisely, experience from the field suggests two main options for valuing\ndegradation. The first relies on damage-based estimates and the second on cost-based\nestimates. Indeed, the damage-based option answers the question, ‘how much damage is\ncaused by environmental degradation?’, and tries to estimate the loss of welfare caused by\nthese degradations on human health and thus on human capital. \nCost-based estimates instead answer the question, ‘how much would it cost to avoid\nenvironmental degradation?’, and in turn can be divided into two types. The first type relies\non maintenance costs, that is, the value of the costs that would have had to be incurred to\nremedy the environmental degradation caused by current production and consumption, and\nleads to ‘environmentally adjusted’ aggregates for those costs. As such, it estimates what the\naccounting entries would have been for the same level (and structure) of activities and\ndemand if all the costs associated with environmental degradation had been incurred and\ninternalized within market prices. The problem with this approach is that the resultant price\nrises (potentially high for non-marginal changes) are likely to bring about a change in\nbehavior, which would affect the level of demand for those products (and thus the level of\noutput and/or the choice of the production technology). \n2.\nOn these difficulties and some proposals, see in particular Vanoli (1995).\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n241\nThe second type of cost-based estimate attempts to overcome those limitations and\nanswers the following question: ‘What level of GDP would be achieved if producers and\nconsumers faced a different set of relative prices in the economy due to the existence of actual\nprices for environmental functions?’ It is thus a forward-looking modeling approach (known\nas greened economy modeling) rather than a one-time adjustment to a selected number of\nmacro-aggregates. Interest then focuses less on the new ‘greened’ aggregates themselves than\non the gap between the existing economy and the ‘greened’ version (and on the possible\ntransition paths between the two).\nThis need to rely on some joint physical and economic modelling at some stage or another\nwill systematically reappear later on, whatever the approach preferred. \nBut there is a more fundamental problem with green GDP, which also applies to Nordhaus\nand Tobin’s SMEW and to the ISEW/GNI indexes. None of these measures characterize\nsustainability per se. Green GDP just charges GDP for the depletion of or damage to\nenvironmental resources. This is only one part of the answer to the question of sustainability.\nWhat we ultimately need is an assessment of how far we are from these sustainable targets. In\nother words, what we need are measures of overconsumption or, to put in dual terms, of\nunderinvestment. This is precisely what our last two indicators purports to do.\n2.4. Adjusted net savings (ANS) or changes in extended wealth\nAdjusted net savings (also known as genuine savings) is a sustainability indicator building\non the concepts of green national accounts and whose theoretical background is again\nHicksian interpretation of income and wealth, but the focus is now on savings, i.e. the\nvariation of wealth. It is this variation that, if negative, will send the signal that current\nconsumption levels will not be possibly maintained over the future. Alternatively, following\nArrow et al. (2004), one may prefer to label this indicator as “genuine investment”, referring\nto the change in the total capital stock, insofar as what is being measured in practice under the\nname of “extended wealth” is an “extended capital stock”. The analogy with the case of\nindividual wealth is straightforward: if I have disinvested or dissaved this year to finance my\nconsumption, this implies that I am poorer at the end of the year. Eventually, I will have the\npossibility to dissave again next year to maintain this level of overconsumption. But I know\nthat I will not be able to do so indefinitely: one day or later, I will have to adjust my\nconsumption downwards.   Such concepts clearly appear to be the relevant economic\ncounterparts of the notion of sustainability, in that they include not only the natural resource\npart of the problem but also (in principle at least) those other ingredients that may provide\nfuture generations an opportunity set that is at least as large as that being faced by currently\nliving generations. \nEquipped with these definitions, researchers at the World Bank (see, in particular,\nHamilton, Pearce and Atkinson, 1996; Hamilton and Clemens, 1999) took the lead in\ncomputing “adjusted net savings” (ANS) for a large number of countries. The World Bank\nReport for 2004 contains estimates of these “net domestic saving” for almost all countries in\nthe world. Empirically, adjusted net savings are derived from standard national accounting\nmeasures of gross national savings by making four types of adjustments. First, estimates of\ncapital consumption of produced assets are deducted to obtain net national savings. Then\ncurrent expenditures on education are added to net domestic savings as an appropriate value\nof investments in human capital (in standard national accounting these expenditures are\n\n242\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\ntreated as consumption). Next, estimates of the depletion of a variety of natural resources are\ndeducted to reflect the decline in asset values associated with their extraction and harvest.\nEstimates of resource depletion are based on the calculation of resource rents. An economic\nrent represents the excess return to a given factor of production. Rents are derived by taking\nthe difference between world prices and the average unit extraction or harvest costs (including\na 'normal' return on capital). Finally, global pollution damages from carbon dioxide emissions\nare deducted3. Negative adjusted net saving rates imply that total wealth is in decline, and as\nsuch provide a warning of unsustainability.\nHow does this indicator compares to standard measures of saving and investment in\nnational accounts. As exemplified on Figures 2.1 and 2.2 for France and the USA, the level of\nANS is mainly driven by gross saving adjusted for capital consumption and education\nexpenditure, and appears to be very marginally affected by other corrections (even if\nadjustments for natural resources depletion were not that marginal in the USA during the\n80’s).\n \n3.\nAs for local pollution damages, they are difficult to estimate without location-specific data. Nevertheless, an\naugmented version of ANS for local pollution is also provided by taking into account health damages due to urban\nair pollution (particulate matter PM10).\nFigure 2.1: From GNS to ANS.

In particular, natural resources-exporting countries\ntend to be unsustainable, according to this measure (figure 2.3).\nThose numbers have the advantage of benefiting from a consistent conceptual framework\ndefining sustainability. The seminal and regularly updated work by the World Bank to collect\ndata for those estimations of ANS is a significant contribution towards true wealth\naccounting. \nNevertheless, current methodology underlying empirical calculations of the ANS per\ncountry has well-known shortcomings, articulated by the authors themselves4. Some of them\ncould be easily handled out. For instance, it is rather straightforward to provide further\nadjustments taking into account technical progress and population dynamics (considering\nadjusted net savings per capita). But, more generally, the relevance of the ANS approach\ncrucially depends on what is counted (the different forms of capital passed through to future\ngenerations), namely what is included in the “extended wealth”, and on the price used to\ncount and aggregate (what is counted) in a context of imperfect valuation by markets. \nThe authors acknowledge that “the calculations are not comprehensive in that they do not\ninclude some important sources of environmental degradation such as underground water\ndepletion, unsustainable fisheries, and soil degradation” (Where is the wealth of Nations,\n2006, pp. 154), and a fortiori biodiversity loss. As for pricing environmental degradations, in\nthe absence of any market valuation, accounting prices must be evaluated by modeling long\nterm consequences of given changes in environmental capital and how they impact\nprospective well-being. We have some established pieces of theory that tell us how this can be\ndone but practical implementation raises considerable problems. Appendix 3 provides in-\ndepth analysis of such shortcomings and feasible improvements. These implementation\nproblems will be at the center of the arguments developed in section 3.  \n2.5. Footprints\nThe Ecological Footprint was initially proposed by Wackernagel and Rees (1995). Since\nthen, it has been sponsored by Redefining Progress and the WWF, which provides regularly\nupdates of the index in its annual Living Planet Report, and has gained increasing popularity\namong green NGOs and public opinion. Methodology and updates are currently maintained\nby the Global Footprint Network.\nThe Ecological Footprint (EF hereafter) measures “how much of the regenerative capacity\nof the biosphere is used by human activities (consumption). It does so by calculating the\namount of biologically productive land and water area required to support a given population\nat its current level of consumption and resource. A country’s Footprint (demand side) is the\ntotal area required to produce the food, fiber and timber that it consumes, absorb the waste it\ngenerates, and provide areas for its infrastructures (built-up areas). On the supply side,\nbiocapacity is the productive capacity of the biosphere and its ability to provide a flux of\n4.\nMany other authors have tried to improve the original indicator: Arrow et al. (2004) for major world areas,\nHanley et al. (1999) and Pezzey et al. (2006) for Scotland, Lange and Wright (2004) for Bostwana, Arrow et al.\n(2008) for the US and China, Nourry (2008) for France and Randall (2008) for Australia….\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n245\nbiological resources and services useful to humanity”, as Moran, Wackernagel and co-authors\n(2008) phrased it.\nResults are well-known and rather striking (figure 2.4): since the mid-1980s humanity’s\nfootprint is larger than the planet's carrying capacity and in 2003 humanity’s total Footprint\nexceeded the Earth’s biocapacity by approximately 25 per cent (we would have needed an\nextra 25% Planet to meet our needs, to say it informally). While 1.8 global hectares per person\nare available world-wide, Europeans use 4.9 global hectares per person and North Americans\nuse twice that amount, that is much more than the actual bio-capacities of the two\ngeographical zones.\nUndoubtedly, the phrasing, the concepts and the results are very appealing  and seem very\neasy to understand. Those reasons explain the success of this indicator, among citizens and\ninternational influential bodies. But these pedagogical qualities do not mean that the indicator\nis without weaknesses, and, just as the ANS, but for very different reasons, it has been\ncriticized on many of its aspects5.\nSome very general criticisms are the fact that  the index gives no weight to possibilities\noffered by technical progress, or the fact that it is mute on unsustainability problems that\nresult from the extraction of fossil resources, or on items such as biodiversity or water quality. \nEven on what it is supposed to do well, the indicator raises some problems. To look at\nthem a bit more closely, let’s consider the 6 different types of land use separately.\nFor cropland, the Ecological Footprint accounts do not rely on the definition of a\n“sustainable” agricultural yield,  a yield leaving soils with sufficient quality to offer the same\nyield next year for instance. On the contrary, the biocapacity is indeed the observed capacity\nobtained from real yield. As a consequence, at the country level, the footprint of production\nwill always equal the biocapacity of the country for cropland. This has two consequences.\nFirst, at the country level, ecological deficit for cropland will only mirror trade deficit.\nSecond, at the worldwide level, exports and imports clear up and thus Ecological Footprint\nand Biocapacity for cropland will always be equal. \nThose points are not concealed by the authors6 but are not really put forward when\ninterpreting and analysing the results. Van den Bergh and Verbruggen (1999) had already\npointed out what they call the substantial anti-trade bias inherent of the Ecological Footprint\nmethodology7. The fact that densely populated regions, hence low biocapacity countries like\nthe Netherlands, have ecological deficits whilst sparsely populated regions, hence high\nbiocapacity countries such as Finland, enjoy surplus can be seen as part of the normal trade of\ngoods to the mutual benefits of both, and is by no means an indicator of unsustainability.\nIndeed, the most recent update of the methodology (Calculation methodology v1.0, 2008)\n5.\nA recent and more extensive review of the index has been provided by the French CESE (Le Clezio, 2009)\nand by the French Ministry of Ecology (CGDD, 2009)\n6.\nSee Calculation Methodology for the National Footprint Accounts, 2008 Edition, version 1.0.\n7.\nOne should notice that, unlike adjusted net savings, EF is based on final consumption (or final demand), that\nis production + imports - exports. To put it differently, the required equivalent land area for a given consumption is\nattributed to the resource consumer rather than the producer. For instance, non-renewables extracted in a\ndeveloping country and exported to a developed country (e.g oil) count towards the developed country’s EF.\n\n246\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nacknowledged that a country’s ecological credit is not in itself a sufficient criterion for\nsustainability. Moran, Wackernagel et al. (2008) moved away from comparing a country’s EF\nwith its own biocapacity, and proposed rather to divide all countries’ EFs by global\nbiocapacity. By doing so, they acknowledge that EFs are not intended as measures of a\ncountry’s own sustainability, but more of its contribution to global unsustainability. Yet the\nfact that no ecological deficit can exist for cropland at the worldwide level remains. At this\nworldwide level, this indicator is not informative at all on the excess pressure that men, on the\naverage, exert on the regenerative capacity of this cropland. The same reasoning applies to\ngrazing land. Once again, at the country level, ecological deficit will only mirror the trade\ndeficit on livestocks products and ecological deficit at the worldwide level is impossible.\nRegarding built-up lands, demands placed on this land use type always equal the\nbiocapacity, as they both represent the cropland area lost for providing those services. Hence,\nthe contribution of that type of land to the overall ecological deficit is null.\nConcerning demands placed on fishing grounds and forest lands, the EF provides a\ntreatment that seems more completely in line with a full sustainability perspective, that is the\nflow of consumption available leaving the stock unchanged for next year. Nevertheless, at the\nworldwide level, one observes that biocapacity exceeds footprint, suggesting that there is no\nsustainability problems regarding the use of those resources. Moreover, shall they turn into a\ndeficit, one must keep in mind that they represent quite a small part of the overall EF\n(respectively 9% and 3% for forest land and fishing grounds). \nLast, but not least, carbon uptake land is the amount of forest land required to uptake\ncarbon dioxide anthropogenic emissions.  In 2005, it is the largest contributor (more than\n50 %) to humanity’s current total Ecological Footprint and increased more than tenfold from\n1961 to 2005. In the standard presentation of the Footprint, there is no formal biocapacity in\nfront of the demand for waste (CO2) assimilation. Note that an alternative view could be to\naggregate the footprint (area of forest) needed to supply wood for construction, fuel and paper\nand the footprint needed to absorb CO2 emissions, and to compare this aggregate with the\nbiocapacity of forest, as forest is indeed the counterpart used to monitor carbon dioxide\nabsorption and each use (wood products and CO2 absorption) puts a competitive demand on\nthe same unit of forest. In doing so, we would be able to display a huge global deficit in forest\nland, mirroring the overaccumulation of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. \nTill now, we have reviewed potential unbalances for each kind of land separately. To\naggregate those different areas and come up with one single figure, both biocapacity and\nfootprints originally measured in hectares are expressed in terms of a standardized land area\nunit, termed global hectare. It is a way to re-weight land areas according to their relative\npotential agricultural productivity. This potential is assessed through the spatial GAEZ model\nof potential agricultural yields framed by IIASA and FAO. As an example, consider one\nhectare of cropland and one hectare of forest. The GAEZ model would tell you that the\npotential yield of the cropland area is twice the potential yield for forest land. Then, while\naggregating cropland and forest land to compute overall footprint, cropland areas will be\nweighted twice forest areas. This is not neutral for policy recommendations as forest will\ngenerally have lower equivalence factor (weights), and as such, a heavy substitution from\nforest to cultured lands will directly increase the overall biocapacity available and will\nalleviate consequently the ecological deficit. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n247\nIn short, the apparent simplicity of the EF hides several difficulties and this often argues in\nfavour of better focussing its real contribution and of maybe less extensive but more\ntransparent approaches. Comparisons of EFs between countries should be used, shall it be\nused, as an indicator of inequality of consumption and interdependencies between\ngeographical areas (e.g. Mac Donald and Patterson, 2004). But the main message conveyed\nby the Ecological Footprint, and it is indeed a message, is that humanity, and notably western\ndeveloped countries, has increased dramatically the level of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere\nduring the last 40 years (figure 2.4). Those annual emissions are far above the level that could\nbe assimilated by nature, with the well-known consequences on temperature and climate. The\nmethodological approach in the Footprint calculations consist in expressing those emissions\nin terms of the required equivalent surface (forest) to absorb them. It gives the flavour and the\nsense of this tremendous problem to the man on the street, and it is its most valuable virtue.\nBut its value-added compared to true carbon accounts is not striking otherwise. \nIndeed, the Ecological Footprint methodology provides interesting elements for a full\ncarbon account of consumption, as the carbon footprint at the country level takes into account\nnot only direct CO2 emissions, but also indirect emissions embodied in imported goods. More\ngenerally, carbon accountancy (see the “Bilan Carbone” methodology in France for instance)\nis probably a more promising attempt to monitor the demand we (a country, a local\ncommunity, a citizen…) place on available waste absorptive capacity of our ecosystem.\nFigure 2.4: Humanity’s ecological footprint by component 1961-2005\nSource: Ewing et al.

Single index approaches to sustainability: where are the obstacles? \nLet’s try to sum up the general impression that emerges from the rapid overview proposed\nin section 2. This section has shown the large number of existing attempts to quantify\nsustainability. Up to a certain point, such an abundance is normal. Sustainability is not a one-\ndimensional issue and, at some moment or another, we have to control it through relatively\nlarge sets of indicators: this is precisely the case we made in favour of dashboards. \nBut from another point of view, abundance is often considered as a serious drawback. If\nwe want to draw attention of public opinion or policy makers on sustainability issues, one\nwould also like to have some synthetic headline figures able to compete with the popularity of\nGDP. Such was precisely the ambition of many of the indicators that we have reviewed in the\nfirst section and, in this respect, it becomes a real problem to see all these so-called summary\nindexes providing such different views on the sustainabilities of different countries.\nJust to insist upon how far these discrepancies can go, we have plotted against each other\nthe values of three indicators available in a systematic way for almost all countries in the\nworld (figures 3.1 and 3.2): the Environmental Sustainability Index, the Adjusted Net Savings\nas computed by the World Bank (in % of GNI) and the Ecological Footprint. \nIn both cases, the relationships confirm that the links are weak and that messages can go in\nopposite directions. The ESI and the ANS display a small positive correlation due to the fact\nthat they both have a bias in favor of more developed countries. Concerning the ESI, this is\ndue among other things to the weight it gives to active environmental policies and the quality\nof institutions that support these policies. Concerning the ANS, this is due to the fact that\ndeveloped countries are more able to accumulate physical and human capital while the\nexploitation of exhaustible resources is more often concentrated in southern countries. The\ncorrelation is of the same sign for the ANS and the EF, but must now be read in the other\ndirection : countries sustainable from the point of view of the ANS have higher EF’s and are\ntherefore less sustainable or, more precisely, contribute more to global unsustainability than\ncountries with low ANS’s.  \nIs it possible to go beyond such inconsistencies and to ultimately agree on one shared\nrepresentation of global sustainability? If yes, this would provide a major breakthrough. But\nwe shall see that the answer is unfortunately not positive, for reasons that are deep ones and\nnot likely to be solved easily. These reasons need to be properly understood, if we want to\norient our efforts in the appropriate directions. This is the main purpose of this section. \nOur analysis will have two steps. The first step will answer the following question: if we\nwere asked to produce only one global indicator of sustainability, what is the methodology\nthat one should apply? The crucial element here is the aggregation procedure required for\ncombining all the very heterogeneous elements that matter for future well-being (subsection\n3.1). Some recent economic literature proposes one answer to this question, that neither\nretains the naïve assumptions that market prices are good guides for this aggregation, nor\nconsiders that such a relative valuations can be only left to arbitrariness. Simple examples will\nshow how such a framework would perform in stylized settings, including a potential capacity\nto subsume the traditional opposition between weak and strong approaches to sustainability\n(subsection 3.2). \nBut this framework also highlights the very strong requirements of such an ideal index and\nit is therefore a good point of departure for systematically analyzing all the problems one that\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n249\nhas encounters when trying to  quantify sustainability. We do not pretend to explore\nsystematically all of them, but we shall raise some points that have appeared to be particularly\ncrucial.  We shall first argue that this framework shows how important are the  technical and\nnormative uncertainties that make univocal assessments of sustainability very difficult to\nprovide (subsection 3.3 and 3.4). We will then use it to clarify the difficulties raised by the\ninternational dimension of the problem (subsection 3.5). All this will pave the way for the\nmore eclectic recommendations that will be proposed in the concluding section 4. \nFigure 3.1: Relationship between the ESI and ANS indexes\nFigure 3.2: Relationship between the ANS and the EF indexes\n\n250\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\n 3.1. If we had to build one single sustainability indicator, how should we try to proceed?  \nFrom what has been seen in section 2, at least one consensual point should emerge, which\nis that the sustainability issue is about what we leave to future generations and whether we\nleave enough resources of all kinds to provide them with opportunity sets at least as large as\nthe ones we have had for ourselves. This is the basis of what one is generally presented as a\n“stock”, “wealth”, “asset” or “capital based” approach to sustainability.  The assets to be\nconsidered are  numerous: fossil resources, other renewables environmental resources, but\nalso physical, human and social capital, or general knowldege. To avoid any\nmisunderstanding, presenting them as “assets” or “capital goods” does not mean at all that we\nconsider that these assets should all be privately owned or submitted to market forces. Many\nof them are collective assets that cannot be managed efficiently by market mechanisms.\nThis “wealth” or “stock based” view of sustainability has, for instance, provided the basic\nparadigm for the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment monitored by the United Nations\nbetween 2001 and 2005 and which, at this stage, constitutes the reference inventory for\nenvironmental trends all over the planet. Such a conceptual framework is, of course, fully in\nline with economists’ traditional views on dynamic aspects of well-being (see box 2). It is\nalso interesting to observe that reference to this notion of wealth is shared by several\nheterodox authors (see for France Méda, 1999 or Viveret, 2002).: All this suggests that we\nhold here a common language that can help convergence between a wide variety of points of\nview. \nJust to take one example, let’s recall one of the frequent ‘heterodox’ criticisms addressed\nto standard GDP, the fact that, from the point of view of this index, destructions of natural or\nphysical capital can be counted positively, because of the positive impact that repairing can\nhave on activity. To be exact, it is not always the case that this repairing activity will increase\nGDP: it does so only if it generates a net increase in activity, not if there is simply a\nreallocation of work between normal activities and these repairing activities. Yet, when an\nincrease in activity actually takes place, it is correct to say that GDP sends an inappropriate\nmessage if interpreted in terms of well-being. The stock based approach to sustainability\nclearly avoids such a paradoxical result, in a way that has close links to the question of\ndefensive expenditures raised at length in the contribution of subgroup 1. In this stock-based\napproach, a catastrophe is registered as a capital loss, i.e. an impoverishment and an\nimmediate threat on  sustainability. Repairing activities will be counted as investments but\nwhose function will only be to compensate for the initial loss. They do not make us wealthier\nif the initial capital loss has been adequately registered. And since this is investment, this\nshould not enter into the evaluation of current well-being: without the catastrophe, people\ncould have enjoyed more positive activities than just restoring the conditions that prevailed\nbefore the catastrophe. \nThis being said, all the problems and possible divergences arise when one comes to\nquantification. The basic element of quantification is to measure changes in quantities or\nqualities of these different assets or resources, what is called “physical measures”.\nMeasurement problems are already considerable at this stage, but let’s assume they have been\novercome. At a given point in time, we observe by how much we accumulate some stocks, in\na way that should contribute positively to future well-being. We also observe how we deplete\nor depreciate others, in a way that contributes negatively to future well-being. The question is\nhow much sustainability or unsustainability this represents on the whole? If we impose to\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n251\nourselves the constraint of answering this question with only one number then we must find a\nkey for aggregating all these physical variations. \nFor assets or resources that are traded in markets, one way to value their contributions to\nfuture well-being can be to use prices currently observed on markets. But, already for this\nsimple case, we know that there are many reasons why such an approach is problematic. The\nfirst one is that, even when prices exist, there is a risk that they misrepresent the true long\nterm contributions of corresponding assets to well-being because of their incapacity to fully\nincorporate all the externalities -positive or negative- that can be associated to the\naccumulation of these assets. Even if such was not the case, there is the additional problem\nthat such prices also reflect myopic or irrational behaviors of investors or resource-holders,\noften leading to erratic changes around fundamentals. For instance, one just has to think of the\nhuge variations that have been observed for financial assets or oil prices over the recent years. \nBox 2: Sustainability, wealth and intertemporal approaches to well-being\nMeasures of sustainability that we discuss in the text have links with the more global question of\nmeasuring social well-being in an intertemporal perspective. Yet We try here to sum up the main ideas in\nliterary terms, the reader being referred to section 3 of M. Fleurbaey’s contribution to the commission for a\nmuch more rigourous argumentation (Fleurbaey, 2008).\nWealth and intertemporal well-being: two twin concepts\nThe intertemporal dimension of well-being can be introduced by starting from the individual point of\nview. The idea is that an individual’s current well-being does not only depend upon what she consumes or\nenjoys right now, it also depends on what she expects to consume or enjoy in the more or less distant\nfuture. She can be satisfied with a relatively low level of immediate resources if she expects that it will\nraise overtime. Conversely, she will remain poorly satisfied with a currently high standard of living if she\nknows that this will be only a short-lived episode. The natural treatment of this intertemporal dimension  is\nto consider that this individual’s global well-being V is better measured as a weighted combination of her\ncurrent and future levels of instantaneous well-being U. In practice, this weighted combination generally\ntakes the form of a discounted sum of U’s.\nHow does this notion relate to wealth? The link is direct. We know that the rigourous definition for the\nvalue of an asset is the discounted sum of dividends that it will generate at all future periods. In the same\nway, the right definition of an individual’s wealth is to measure it as the discounted value of future\nconsumptions or enjoyments that she can plan to derive from her current endowments and this is nothing\nelse than the definition of intertemporal well-being. Of course, it must be clear that such a concept of\nwealth goes far beyond the standard notion of financial of physical wealth. Owning financial or material\nassets increases for sure a person’s possibility set in terms of future consumption. But having a high level\nof schooling, being in good health or benefiting from a large social network are also some forms of current\nwealth that enlarge one’s perspectives of earning money, consuming and/or enjoying life at later periods. \nWhat if we move to the social point of view? One possibility could be to aggregate these prospective\nV’s for all individuals alive at the current period. But, from a collective point of view, this is only one\naspect of the problem. Collectivities are expected to survive beyond the life horizons of their current\nmembers, these members being continuously replaced by new ones. This means that intertemporal well-\nbeing of a given collectivity rather needs to be measured as a discounted sum of consumptions or\nenjoyments by all its current or future members at all future dates. If we do so, we will have the same\ncorrespondance between the notion of intertemporal social welfare and a concept of current “extended\nwealth” aggregating the utility-generating potential of all our current endowments, not only for ourselves,\nbut also for all future generations.  We shall use the letter W to characterize this extended concept of\nwealth. \nThe difficulties of such an evaluation  are however considerable, as highlighted long ago by\nSamuelson (1961). According to his own terms, this puts quite a large amount of “futurity” in our\n\n252\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nevaluation of social well-being, and makes it quite impossible in practice. Even if we were able to produce\nvery long term projections of future instantaneous consumption or well-being, we would remain\nconfronted to the issue of discounting, i.e. of deciding how to weigh the relative well-beings of people\nliving today and of people leaving 100 years ahead from now or more. This remains the matter of many\ndebates. Discounting is anavoidable from a practical point of view (to avoid infinite sums), but is ethically\nproblematic: in principle, all people should be treated equally, irrespective of their date of birth. Anyway,\nwhatever we do, practical indexes of welfare requiring an intertemporal aggregation until the end of times\nare both hard to build, and clearly hard to communicate upon.  \nTwo ways of measuring sustainability: sustainable well-being or changes in global wealth\nBecause of these difficulties, the commission did not choose to emphasize such a long run\nintertemporal view of social well-being. Subgroups 1 and 2 on standard GDP issues and Quality of Life\nessentially concentrate on elements that pertain to the current period. \nThe intertemporal dimension is considered in this subgroup 3 through the narrower but not less\nimportant dimension of sustainability, i.e. the question of knowing whether the society will be able, at all\nfuture dates, to have a level of current well-being as high as the one that we have today. The connection\nwith wealth and intertemporal well-being can be stated as follows. Measuring wealth is measuring the size\nof the cake to be divided between successive generations, while measuring sustainability is raising a\nquestion about how this cake will be shared between generations or periods, the objective being to have no\nfuture generation less well-off than the current one. This metaphor of the cake is not fully satisfactory in an\nintertemporal context. In such a dynamic framework, the size of the cake is not fixed but also depends on\nthe behavior of successive generations. Yet this imperfect metaphor helps understanding the difference and\nthe connection between the two notions of global wealth and sustainability.\nNow, there are two traditions in this assessment of sustainability. \nThe first ones tries to define a concept of sustainable consumption or well-being. The idea is to\ncompute the maximum constant level of well-being that can be ensured at all successive periods with\ncurrent levels of resources as a starting point. A large amount of literature has been devoted to the\ncharacterization of this Usust. This was the initial idea of Nordhaus and Tobin’s index of “sustainable\neconomic welfare” and its has been taken over by many successors of this index. This notion has been\nfurther conceptualized by several theoretical papers starting from Weitzman (1976). Back to the empirical\nside, the concept of green GDP can also be viewed as one partial attempt to compute this sustainable well-\nbeing. \nThere are however two limits in this approach. First, concerning green GDP, we must emphasize that it\nonly corresponds to a partial version of this Usust concept. It measures production net of environmental\ndegradations, but does not take into account forms of accumulation or decumulation of many forms of\nassets, specifically of intangible assets. Second, even if we were able to measure Usust in a satisfactory\nway, this is by no means a sufficient statistic for characterizing sustainability. To put it simply, fully\nreplacing GDP by a measure of green GDP does not help us assessing whether we are on a sustainable path\nor not. Measuring sustainability requires comparing this green GDP to our actual consumption of\nresources. Rephrasing it in terms of utilities or well-being, what is needed to assess sustainability is the (U,\nUsust) couple. We are on a sustainable path as long as U≤Usust. We are in an unsustainable situation as\nsoon as U becomes higher that Usust.\nThe second tradition consists in building an indicator that directly measures this gap between what we\nconsume or enjoy and what would be sustainably enjoyable. This gap can be captured by the change in\nextended wealth dW and computations of  adjusted net savings are one attempt to quantify this change. The\nintuition is simple. An increase in wealth between t and t+1 means that we start at period t+1 with\nresources that should allow maintaining the level of well-being that we had at time t without compromising\nthe future. A decrease in wealth means that we start at time t+1 with a lower endowment that the one we\nstarted with at time t. This does not necessarily forbid consuming as much in t+1 than we did in t. But this\nclearly means that we will not be able to do it indefinitely. One day or later, society will have to adjust its\nstandard of living downwards, and the adjustement will be all the more violent that it will come late.\nAs it was the case with the computation of W, the message will be sensitive to the choice of the\ndiscount factor ρ, but with a somewhat different meaning. When we compute W, the choice of ρ is an\nethical problem, i.e. knowing which relative weights we give to well-being today or well-being tomorrow.\nWhen we compute dW and use it as an indicator of sustainability, the choice of ρ rather affects the\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n253\nanticipatory power of the index. Choosing a value of ρ is like the choice of a focal distance for binoculars.\nA high value for ρ  will allow focussing on risks of a downturn in U in a relatively near future. But, with\nsuch values, the indicator will be silent on downturns of U that are expected for a very distant future.\nWarning messages on long term unsustainability will only appear if a low value is adopted for ρ. \nThis connection between wealth and sustainability also means that it can make sense to look at them\nsimultaneously. This is precisely what did the World Bank in its most recent evaluations of Adjusted Net\nSavings (World Bank, 2006). Not unsurprisingly, these evaluations show that most of the “wealth of\nnations” lies in intangible resources such as skills, human capital, in conformity with an intuition already\nput forward by Adam Smith more than two centuries ago. Yet this predominance of human capital is\nessentially true for developed countries, a much larger share of the wealth of poor countries consisting in\ntheir natural assets. And, unfortunately, Adjusted Net Savings for these countries often come out as\nnegative, because the exploitation of these natural resources is not compensated by sufficient accumulation\nof other physical or human assets. This does not necessarily dismiss the responsibility of developed\ncountries in such a state of affairs. Neither does it mean that these less-developed countries should\nconsume less. The message can rather be that they have to invest more efficiently. All this just emphasize\nthe exposition of these poorer resource-dependent countries to medium term problems of unsustainability,\nand the associated risk of an increasing worldwide inequality. \nAnyway, even if we were ready to believe in the validity of market prices when they exist,\nthere remains the problem of assets that are not traded as such on any market, for which no\ndirect prices are observable. Excluding them from computations is the kind of answer we\nhave to avoid.  We have to find alternative procedures. \nIn some cases, indirect monetisation still seems possible in a relatively straightforward\nmanner. Let’s take the example of human capital, presented with more detail in appendix 3.\nFor this form of capital, the strategy used by initial versions of the ANS was to value its\naccumulation by the monetary cost of producing new human capital, i.e. education\nexpenditures. This solution is obviously too crude: it ignores depreciation of this human\ncapital and the fact that the same level of expenditures can produce human capital of very\ndifferent qualities.  \nAn alternative way is to use the partial information brought in by the labour market:\nhuman capital is valued by the discounted flow of labor incomes that it is expected to\ngenerate. This assumes that we can extrapolate in the future the current rates of return on this\nhuman capital. Of course, this is once again a disputable hypothesis. We cannot warrant that\nreturns on education will be the same tomorrow as they are today. But, on such an issue, we\nhave the feeling that some reasonable valuation methods are not fully out of hand and that\nthey can help us comparing intensities of net human capital accumulation across countries or\nover time.\nThe problem appears much more complicated for environmental assets, for which the\ninformation provided by markets becomes very limited  or even non existent.  \nIn some cases, a frequent solution is to use estimates of costs of avoiding the degradation\nof these assets, for instance the cost of installations that would fully avoid the emission of\nsuch or such pollutant in the atmosphere, or the prices than one would have to fix to maintain\nlevels of emission or environmental degradation below some given targets, as it is for instance\ndone for the valuation of CO2 emissions. Such a solution remains unfortunately unsatisfactory\nfor what we want to do. It can fit for indexes of the green GDP style. Green GDP measures\n\n254\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nwhat we would be able to produce without deterioration of the environment: in such a\nperspective, it is an appropriate strategy to subtract from standard GDP or NNP the potential\ncost that we would have to incur in order to maintain the environment in its current state. But\nwe have seen that green GDP is not exactly the right answer to the specific issue of\nsustainability. \nWhat sustainability indices have to measure is something else: we want them to tell us\nwhether damages that are currently made to the environment are going to drive the well-being\nof future generations below the one that we enjoy today. It is only under strong conditions that\nthere can be equivalence between this long run impact and the current marginal cost of\npollution abatement. This equivalence occurs only if we currently optimize between the\npresent costs of these abatements and the benefits that will result from them in the future. It is\nexcessively restrictive to assume that such is the case in the real world. \nIn fact, what a true measure of sustainability requires is a direct evaluation of what these\nfuture damages are going to be, and how they are going to affect future well-being. And, to be\nexhaustive, the same kind of imputation is in fact required for all other assets: even when they\nhave some apparent market values, their true valuations should be based on the net expected\namounts of services that there are expected to deliver tomorrow, in interaction with other\nassets, and we know that the absence of markets for only a subset of goods leads to biased on\nprices for all goods, not only the ones that cannot be traded. For instance, if capital\naccumulation is, everything else equal, good news for the well-being of tomorrow, but if it\nsimultaneously puts a strongly negative pressure on then environment, then this external\neffect should be reflected negatively in the present value of these capital goods and it is quite\nlikely that current market prices will not do that. \n3.2. How would the indicator behave in some typical cases?\nHow should all these problems be treated? The informational requirements are\nconsiderable. As soon as market prices are not a reference, we need to rely on imputed or\nshadow prices and these imputations require no less than a full projection model for the\neconomy, the environment and their interactions, and a perfect anticipation of how these\nchanges are going to affect tomorrow’s well-being (Arrow, Dasgupta and Mäler, 2003). \nLet’s try to get an idea of what this means in a very stylized example. This report is not the\nplace for a thorough exploration of these analytical properties of sustainability indexes, but a\nfew illustrations are nevertheless interesting to examine8.  The illustrative setting that we shall\nuse assumes that there are only two “assets”: produced capital that can consist either in\nphysical or human capital or a mix of them, and a natural resource. Produced capital plays the\nusual role it has in economic growth models: it determines output, and it is accumulated by\nreinvesting part of this output, the other part consisting in consumption which is one of the\ncomponents of well-being. Produced capital is also subject to depreciation. This specification\nimplies that, in terms of economic production, we ultimately converge towards a stationary\n8.\n Technical details are not provided but are available upon request. As a general rule, it is an interesting way\nof testing indexes to try to examine their behavior in theoretical settings, in parallel to their implementation on real\ndata. If they fail to deliver interpretable messages in such theoretical settings, it is a sufficient condition for having\nthem discarded. If they pass the test but only in some cases, it helps us identifying for which cases they are useful\nor misleading. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n255\nstate for both its capital stock and its output, which is determined by the investment rate and\nthe depreciation rate. This occurs after a period of continuous growth, if the economy starts\nfrom a capital stock that is lower than its equilibrium value, or eventually after a period of\ncontinuous “degrowth”, if the economy adopts an investment rate that is not sufficient to\nmaintain its initial capital stock. \nThe environmental dimension is then introduced through the existence of a renewable\nresource that is essential to well-being and that stops regenerating sufficiently once a certain\nproduction threshold is reached, through the kind of mechanism that footprint indexes aim at\ncapturing. Passed this point, the natural asset starts depreciating in an irreversible way, and,\nunder our assumptions, this ultimately drives well-being to zero, even if economic production\ngoes on increasing.  \nIt is in such framework that we have tested what would be the behavior of a generalized\nsavings rate indice built according to the principles outlined above. The idea is that, at each\nperiod, we observe net variations for produced capital and for environmental capital and that\nwe aggregate them according to their relative contributions to the future sequence of current\nwell-beings, discounted at a certain rate. We shall say that we have a negative sustainability\ngap when the indice is below zero: it warns us that well-being is going to decline sooner or\nlater below its current level. \nFigure 3.3 starts by a situation where this environmental constraint is never binding but\nwhere unsustainability occurs because of unsufficient renewal of produced capital. This is\nwhat we can call a case of economic unsustainability: it comes as no surprise that the index\nproperly points at a negative sustainability gap all over the simulated period. In that case, the\nconcept is close to a standard net savings rate, and it appropriately tells us that savings are not\nsufficient to maintain current well-being. This society lives above its means. Indexes\nfocussing on the environmental component would send no message concerning this form of\nunsustainability. This gives at least one good reason for giving some place for such an index\nin any approach to sustainability. \nWhat if unsustainability rather comes from the environmental side? This is the situation\nrepresented on figure 3.4 where capital accumulates and consumption are growing up to the\npoint where the stock of the environnemental good starts declining, leading to a downturn in\nglobal well-being. The indicator built according to the theoretical prescriptions appears here\nagain able to anticipate this situation. If it is built with a high discount rate (5% in our\nexample), it will do it in a relatively myopic way: a negative sustainability gap appears only a\nfew years before well- being starts to decline. But it does send the message however, and it\ndoes it in a much more forward-looking manner when built with a low discount rate of 1%9. \nNow, where does this capacity of anticipation come from? It simply comes from the\nassumption that the index builder is in position to base his assessment on the relevant imputed\nprices that are displayed on figure 3.5, and which appears to have two properties. The first one\nis a strong upward trend in the imputed value of the environmental good that reflects the fact\nthat it becomes increasingly determinant for the evolution of well-being. But this is not\n9.\nOn this influence of the discount rate of the indicator on the messages sent by the index, see the technical\npaper prepared for the commission by M. Fleurbaey (Fleurbaey, 2009). The role of the discount rate in this context\nis somewhat different from the role it has played in controversies surrounding the Stern report: more on this is\npresented further in appendix 4. \n\n256\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nenough. The second requirement, in this particular case, is the fact of immediately attributing\na negative value to the accumulation of physical capital, in anticipation of the fact that its\ncontinuation will ultimately lead us above the critical environmental threshold. \nFigure 3.3: Sustainability gap in a stylized case of economic unsustainability\nReading: In a scenario where consumption and well-being continuously decline due to an sufficient physical\ninvestement, the extended wealth indicator permanently sends the signal that current consumption is not sustainable.\nFigure 3.4: Sustainability gap in a stylized case of environmental unsustainability\nReading: If excessive consumption leads to environmental degradations that ultimately reduces well-being, the\nextended wealth index warns that we are on a non sustainable path, with a capacity of anticipation that depends on\nthe discount rate.\n-0,5\n0\n0,5\n1\n1,5\n2\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nW ell-being\nCom sum ption\nYear\nsustainability gap according to the \nextended wealth concept\n-1\n-0,5\n0\n0,5\n1\n1,5\n2\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nEnvironm ental asset\nConsum ption\nW ell-being\nSustainability gaps according to the extended wealth concept\nYear\nwith a 1%  discount factor\nwith a 5%  discount factor\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n257\nThis example has no pretention to realism,  although some may consider that it actually\ndepicts one of our possible futures, e.g. one of the scenarios of “collapse” analyzed with lots\nof details by Diamond (2008) or of bifurcation scenarios described by climatologists\nconcening long term consequences of climatic change. Its interest is before all pedagogical. It\nshows what are the requisites of a proper functioning of this accounting approach. It is as able\nas other approaches to capture situations of “strong” unsustainability. But this is true only\nunder requirements that are themselves quite strong:\n– It requires a full modelling of the future joint development for the economy and the\nenvironnement, and their impact on the sequence of future levels of well-being. This\nmeans that building the index is in fact no less that a full projection exercise. In fact, the\nindex itself does not bring any additional information to this projection exercise. It is\nonly one way among others to sum up with one single number the whole results of this\nprojection exercise10.\n– It eventually requires being ready to accept strong messages from these models in terms\nof valuation of the different assets. These may  eventually differ in a huge way from\nsignals that can be sent by markets. \nAll this provides a good framework for clarifying the difficulties of the exercise. From\nsuch a starting point, it becomes relatively easy to unfold the various reasons that make\nFigure 3.5: Imputed values for the environmental and produced asssets for the scenario of \nenvironmental unsustainability (for a 1% discount rate)\nReading: The results of figure 3.4 rely upon specific properties of accounting prices: a strongly increasing positive\nvalue for natural capital, and a negative one for produced capital.\n10.\nThe same is true for “sustainability” indexes used in public finance, such as the “tax gap” or indexes of\nimplicit debt for social security administrations: all these indexes are only some ways to sum-up long-run\nprojections of expected surpluses or deficits.  \n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nIm puted unit value for the \nenvironm ental asset\nIm puted unit value for the produced asset\nYear\n\n258\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nsustainability assessment difficult, and specifically when we pretend to do so in\nmonodimensional terms. \n3.3. One first difficulty: behavioral and technical uncertainties.     \nOne first obvious difficulty with sustainability measurement is that, done proprely, it is no\nless than a full projection exercise. Hence, it should come as no surprise to be confronted to\nthe problem that encounters any prospectivist, the fact that the future is uncertain.\nIn the most extreme form, the argument can be that the future will depend on what we shall\nmake of it. Indeed, making a projection also implies projecting behaviors, including the\nbehavior of policy makers. There are as many assessments of sustainability as there are\npossible paths for future policies, and shadow prices are actually one way to evaluate and\ncompare these policies (Dreze and Stern, 1990; DasGupta, 2003). \nLet’s assume however that we refrain from going up to this point. What we are primarily\nrequired to do is to assess sustainability in “business as usual” scenarios, i.e. scenarios where\ncurrent behaviors or policies continue to hold forever. However, even in such cases, sources\nof uncertainties remain considerable:\n– Even if we have the right conceptual model for describing future eco-environmental\ninteractions, there is uncertainty concerning the parametrization of this model, or\nconcerning the magnitude of future external shocks that could cause deviations from the\nbaseline path predicted by this model.\n– There is uncertainty about the model itself: are we really sure that we are using the right\none? Aren’t we neglecting such or such aspect of the environment that may prove of\ncrucial importance tomorrow? This was the case some decades ago concerning climate\nchange or biodiversity. What are the next environmental variables that may come in the\nforefront in the decades to come?  \n– Last but no least, there is uncertainty about one fundamental component of the index\nwhich is the choice of well-being indicator that we use for assessing future states of the\nnature and of the economy. In theory, this strongly intertwines conclusions of this group\nwith conclusions by the two other ones. There as many evaluations of the sustainability\nof well-being as there can be definitions of what current well-being is. \nWithout running into details, let’s elaborate a little bit on these issues and possible answers\nto them, starting with the first two ones. \nFor components of technological uncertainty that are amenable to probabilistic\nformalization, one possibility could be think in terms of confidence interval. We know that no\nindicator can tell us for sure that we are sustainable or not: it can say we are while we are not,\nit can say we are not while we are. One could consider assorting indicators of measures of\nthese two opposite risks. Alternatively, one could consider submitting the indicator to stress\ntests, or present alternative evaluations in worst cases scenarios, in accordance with the\nprecaution principle. These ideas can be a topic of future research, but they already appear a\nbit difficult to apply in practice. \nThe problem is more crucial concerning more radical uncertainties concerning the proper\nmodelling of interactions between the environmental and economic spheres. They leave room\nfor more radically divergent applications of the general framework of section 3.2. The choice\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n259\nof one index against another will reflect divergences in a priori beliefs concerning the model\nthat best describe reality, or also different sensibilities to the risk of using a mistaken model,\nwith some preferring models that are highly conservative on the environmental side, while\nother will accept the risk of underestimating these environmental risks. It has been recognized\nfor long that most of the debates concerning long term environmental changes are not\nnecessarily ideological ones but reflect different beliefs on probability distributions of future\neco-environmental scenarios. There is no reason why sustainability assessment could have\nescaped such difficulties.\nSuch a problem brings us well beyond the problems usually faced by statisticians whose\nordinary job is essentially that of measuring the current state of the world. As far as this\ncurrent state of is concerned, there can be measurement problems and/or divergences over\nhow to aggregate the different characteristics of this state of the world in summary indexes.\nThese problems are already large, but there is in principle no room for heterogeneity of beliefs\nor expectations. Trying to quantify sustainability adds this dimension of assessing the future,\nand heterogeneity of beliefs concerning this future come into play as an additional source of\ncomplexity.\nOne answer to this difficulty could be to provided indexes built from several competing\nmodels. But the pedagogical character of such exercises is not certain, and this encourages to\ntake the problem in another way. If there are some natural items whose interaction with the\neconomic sphere can be large with a significant probability but in a way that is difficult to\nmodel, there is a strong case in favor of separate follow up of these environmental items,\nleaving aside the ambition of incorporating them into one single indicator.   \n3.4. Normative uncertainties: sustainability of what?      \nOn the normative side also, one can say that there are as many indices of sustainability as\nthere are definitions of what we want to sustain. This remark may seem trivial, but it is\nparadoxically not that frequent in the literature. It deserves a few comments. In Standard\nNational Accounting practice, the normative issue of defining preferences is generally\navoided through the assumption that observed prices reveal the real preferences of people. if\napples are cheaper than oranges, it reflects among other things something about peoples\nrelatives tastes for apples and oranges. No normative choice is therefore to be made by the\nstatistician. This would still hold true for sustainability measurement if all the assets we have\nto consider were traded on perfect markets by individuals fully aware of the importance of\nthese assets not only for their own future well-being but also for the future well-being of their\ndescendants. \nAs soon as we consider that market prices cannot be trusted, we lose this indirect\nexpression of revealed preferences. Direct specifications have to be injected in our valuation\ninstruments, and results will be naturally very sensitive to these specifications. Just to\nillustrate that, we have rerun the simulation of figure 3.4. for alternative specifications of\nwell-being: the original specification of this figure 3.4 that gave equal weight to the\nenvironnemtal quality and consumption, and the well-being functions of the pure\nenvironmentalist and of the pure consumerist that give symetric maximal weights to the\nenvironment and to consumption, and no weight at all to the other component. The result goes\nwithout saying but nevertheless deserved being recalled: these two polar assumptions lead to\nentirely different evaluations of sustainability.\n\n260\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nAre there some solutions to this indeterminacy? One could try to solve this problem\nempirically, trying to infer the definition of the adequate well-being function from current\nobservations of how people value environmental factors compared to economic ones. Since\nthis cannot be done from observed prices, we must rely on other means, such as contingent\nvaluations, or direct measures of the impact of environmental amenities on indexes of\nsubjective well-being such as those considered in subgroup 2. But the limits remain\nnumerous. In particular, can contingent evaluations or subjective measures established today\nin a certain eco-environmental setting be used to predict what will be the valuations of future\ngenerations in eco-environmental settings that may have become very different? The good\nproperties of the index depend on the capacity of the well-being function to capture the\nrelative valuation of environmental and non-environmental goods over the full range of\nvariation of their relative quantities.\nSuch a global profile may prove quite hard to infer simply from current observations in a\nnarrow interval of variation of eco-environmental variables. Some may for instance argue that\nour descendants may become very sensitive to the relative scarcity of some environmental\ngoods to which we pay little attention today because they are still relatively abundant, and that\nthe precautionary principle should therefore require that we immediately place a high value\non these items just because we think that our descendants may wish to do so. On the other\nhand, some anti-environmentalists may argue on the opposite: that these future generations\nmay be completely indifferent to the disappearance of some  environmental amenities that we\ncurrently value only because we are used to them. This brings into the debate the  additional\ncomplexity that can stem from changes in well-being over time, changes that may be\nthemselves path dependent.\nPushing further, there is also the problem of knowing how the chosen indicator of well-\nbeing must aggregate individual preferences, i.e. the distributive dimensions of well-being. If\nFigure 3.6: Sustainability gap for the same scenario as figure 3.2 but different specifications \nof well-being \nReading: Messages from the sustainability indicator given on figure 3.4 are strongly modified if we adopt other\nrepresentations of collective preferences concerning consumption and the quality of the environnement.\n-1,2\n-1\n-0,8\n-0,6\n-0,4\n-0,2\n0\n0,2\n0,4\n0,6\n0,8\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nCollective preferences giving no weight to the environmental good\nCollective preferences giving equal weight to both goods\nCollective preferences giving no weight to consumption\nYear\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n261\nfor instance we assume  that a headline indicator of current well-being must be the total\ndisposable income of the bottom x% of the population, rather than global disposable income,\nthen indicators of sustainability must clearly be adapted to such an objective function. This\nwould be completely in line with what was one of the other aspects of the Brundtland\ndefinition of sustainability that is often by-passed, i.e. its additional concern for the\ndistribution of resources within as well as between generations. In a world with natural\ntendencies to increasing inequalities within countries, messages concerning sustainability will\ndiffer depending on the goal that we fix to ourselves. A specific attention to distributional\nissues may even suggest enlarging the list of capital goods that matter for sustainability: the\n“sustainability” of well-being for the bottom x% of the population can imply some specific\ninvestment in institutions that help protecting efficiently this population from poverty. In\nprinciple, our theoretical framework  tells us how we could ideally put some value on such\n“institutional” investment. Arrow et al. (2003) actually mention institutions as some of the\nassets that should be ideally included in a really comprehensive measure of wealth. But\nneedless to say that the prospect of being able to do so is still more remote than for other\nassets. \nIn short, all this question of properly predefining well-being (a) emphasizes the necessary\nlink between conclusions by this subgroup and conclusions from the two other subgroups and\n(b), may be again argument in favor of multiple sustainability indices, corresponding to\ndifferent definitions of what we are trying to sustain. In a sense, this shows that there is no\nintrinsic opposition between the “extended wealth”  approach to sustainability and the idea\noften put forward by partisans of composite indexes that the weighting of the different\ningredients of sustainability should be a matter of democratic debate. The advantages of the\nstock-based approach is that it provides us with a framework that helps identifying what are\nthose items that we have to weight and that its makes clearer on what basis these weights\nshould be computed, compared to arbitrary weighting procedures that are often adopted in\ncomposite indexes. But, as soon as we agree that market prices of assets cannot be the\nreference for the relative valuation, we are brought back to the problem of knowing on which\nbases such valuations can be established.   \n3.5. The cross-national problem: sustainability of whom?\n \nLet’s move on to the properties of indicators in a multinational context. We have seen that\nthis aspect of the problem is another source of major cleavage between the ANS and many\nother approaches to sustainability. According to the index chosen, it is less developed or more\ndeveloped countries that are the most severely concerned by unsustainability, the first ones\nbecause of underinvestment in physical and natural capital and/or because of a poor\nmanagement of their natural resources, the second one because of their high standard of living\nthat puts a lot of pressure on the world’s ecosystem or natural assets. \nOne possible defense of the  ANS view on this issue is to argue that, if markets work\nproperly, the pressure that developed countries exert on other countries’ resources is already\nreflected in the prices that they pay for importing these resources. If, despite this cost of their\nimports, they are still able to have a positive net savings, this means that they invest enough to\ncompensate for their consumption of natural resources. It is then the responsibility of\nexporting countries to reinvest the income from their exports in sufficient quantities if they\nwant to be also on a sustainable path. This is the so called  “Hartwick rule” (Hartwick, 1977),\n\n262\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\naccording to which sustainability for a resource exporting country requires a full reinvestment\nof all its rent. A country that sells a non renewable asset necessarily gets poorer if it does not\nconvert all the resulting income in another asset. \nIn reality, this Hartwick rule needs some to be refined. If we take into account the fact that\nthe price of an exhaustible resources must be on an ascending trend (the Hotelling rule\nphrased in Hotelling (1931)), then the value of a given stock of this resource is expected to\nincrease autonomously over time, and this allows a country to be sustainable even if it does\nnot reinvest the entirety of the income currently derived from this resource. But, once this\ncorrection is made, ANS computations are correct again.\nYet they are so only if an additional assumption is valid, the assumption of efficient\nmarkets. If markets are not efficient and if the natural resource is underpriced, then the\nimporting countries benefit from an implicit subsidy and the exporting ones are taxed. This\nmeans that effective sustainability of the former is overestimated, while the sustainability of\nthe latter is underestimated. This problem will be all the more crucial when there are no\nmarkets at all, or in the presence of strong externalities. \nCan an extended wealth approach handle this difficulty? The answer is not\nstraightforward. Let’s for instance assume a very simple two-country setting with a natural\nresource that is now a global public good with free access. We assume that the two countries\nproduce and consume at each period but with different technologies. Country 2 uses a clean\ntechnology that has no impact on the natural resource, while country 1 uses a “dirty” one, that\nleads to a depreciation of the natural resource. Last, we push further the asymmetry by\nassuming that it is only country 2 that is affected by this degredation of the environmental\ngood. Country 1 is completely indifferent to the level of this environmental good, for instance\nbecause its geographical characteristics fully protects it from consequences of its degradation.\nWith such a setting it is natural to redefine countries 1 and 2 as being respectively “the\npolluter” and “the polluted”. \nHow can the mechanics of imputed prices work in such a context? One possibility consists\nin computing country-specific accounting prices for the natural resource and apply these two\ndifferent prices to the global degradation of the natural asset when computing changes in\nextended wealth for each of the two countries. The difference between the two prices  will\nreflect the fact that the two countries suffer differently from environmental changes. If we do\nso,  it is easy to guess that the accounting price for the polluter will be zero: this polluter is not\nimpacted by environmental changes, and this implies that he attributes no value at all to the\nenvironmental asset. On the other hand, the polluted gives a positive to this asset. If there is a\ndegradation of this natural asset, this will imply characterizing the polluter as sustainable, and\nthe polluted as unsustainable.\nFrom a certain point of view, this result reflects some reality. It is true that it is the\npolluted’s well-being that is going to decline. But from another point of view, the message to\npolicy makers is misleading. Country 2 can do nothing to restore its sustainability. It is only a\nchange in the polluter’s technology that can help restore sustainability for this polluted\ncountry. From this second point of view, what matters is not each country’s own\nsustainability, but each country’s contribution to global unsustainability. This can eventually\nbe done in an extended wealth framework if we are able to compute a global extended wealth\nand impute changes of this global wealth to each of the countries taken separately. But this\nwas more spontaneously the way footprint indicators work. This calls again for a\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n263\ndiversification of approaches, using for each kind of asset the kind of instrument that seems\nthe most relevant. \n4. Conclusion: main messages and tentative recommendations \nTo sum up, what have we learnt, and what can we conclude? This trip through the world of\nsustainability indicators has been a bit lengthy a technical. The issue is indeed complex, more\ncomplex than the already complicated issue of measuring current well-being or performance.\nFor this reason, the conclusions of this subgroup will remain somewhat more open than those\nof the other two subgroups. But we shall nevertheless try to articulate a limited set of three\nmessages followed by four recommendations, which we shall also try to keep as pragmatic as\npossible.\nMessage 1: Measuring sustainability differs from standard statistical practice in a\nfundamental way: to do it adequately, we need projections, not only observations. \nThe usual business of statisticians is to try to measure what happens or what has happened\nin the more or less remote past. When it comes to sustainability, the question turns to\nproducing numbers about the future, which is not yet observed by nature. Admittedly, some\ncould argue that, in a world of perfect capital markets, all the relevant information on this\nfuture path of the economy is conveyed in the current valuation of assets or of the services\nthat they currently provide. If one good is going to be scarce in the future, this should be\nalready reflected in its current price. Such is the implicit view of some existing\nimplementations of the ANS index. But this is clearly a view of the mind. Recent events have\nshown how far well-established capital markets can be mistaken in their implicit predictions\nof future economic developments. This is all the more true in domains where markets are\nnotoriously underdeveloped or non-existent, and such is of course the case in most\nenvironmental domains.\nNeither can we contemplate the idea of measuring sustainability by just questioning\npeople about it -as one is sometimes inclined to do for the measurement of current well-being.\nSuch questions about individual or global perspectives are frequently asked, and the results\nare of course interesting. For instance, according to the 2006 edition of the Eurobarometer\nSurvey conducted for the European Commission, it was 76% of French respondents that\nforesaw a more difficult life for their children than for themselves, with only 8% foreseeing\nthe opposite. Such messages are interesting because of their sharp contrast with standard\nlong-term projections of GDP/capita based on the extrapolation of current productivity trends.\nThey reinforce the conviction that measuring sustainbility is a real issue. But they clearly do\nnot provide a measure of sustainability. They simply measure feelings or beliefs concerning\nsustainability. We clearly need to go further than that. What we expect from statistics is to go\nbeyond such feelings or day-to-day subjective perceptions. \nAll this means that it is definitely impossible to answer the question in the same way as\nusually done with accounts or social statistics. What is needed are projections, and not only\nprojections of technological or environmental trends, but also projections of how they will\ninteract with socio-economic or even political forces. Stated as such, the challenge is extreme.\nIn practice, ambitions will remain much lower, i.e. just providing numbers identifying a risk\nof unsustainability under the continuation of current trends or behaviours. But even that task\n\n264\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nremains a considerable one that goes much beyond the normal job of statisticians and/or of\neconomists. It requires a much broader set of expertise than it is the case for usual accounting\nactivities. \nMessage 2: Measuring sustainability also entails prior responses to normative questions. In\nthis respect too, it strongly differs from standard statistical activity.\nThe coexistence of different appreciations of sustainability may reflect not only different\npredictions of what the future can be, but also different views about what will really matter\ntomorrow for us or our descendants. Let’s put it in another way. Everybody should in\nprinciple converge on the idea that sustainability means the preservation of future well-being.\nBut the question remains to know what well-being we wish to sustain exactly. Some may\nargue that we just have to warrant the constancy of GDP per capita. Some will accept to keep\nsuch a focus on monetary income, but they will put more emphasis on the intragenerational\ndistribution of resources -as the Brundtland report actually did. They will therefore argue that\nwe must try to sustain monetary income for the poorest segments of the population, and the\npolicy implication may be different from the ones derived from the first objective. Some\nothers can choose to put a stronger emphasis on the preservation of such or such element of\nthe environment, such as biodiversity or the quality of landscapes, and so on…\nMaking choices in this respect goes once again far beyond the normal job or normal\nresponsibility of statisticians: they can help clarify the options or help implementing correctly\nthe index once the choices have been made, but they can in no way fully assume the definition\nof objectives.\nMessage 3: Measuring sustainability raises an additional difficulty in an international\ncontext. The question is not exclusively to assess relative sustainabilities of each country\ntaken separately. The problem is global, at least in its environmental dimension. In that case,\nwhat is at stake is rather the contribution of each country to global sustainability or\nunsustainability. \nWe have seen that the treatment of this dimension is actually one strong source of\ndivergence between differents approaches to sustainability, and explains contradictory results\nof these different approaches. More developed countries are, in some sense, the most\nsustainable ones, because they can devote significant resources to capital accumulation, both\nin its physical and human forms. It is not unsurprising to find that many less developed ones\nare on much more fragile trajectories on this economic side. But, from on another point of\nview, it is developed countries that are often the largest contributors to worlwide\nenvironmental unsustainability, at least in its climatic dimension. \nAll these messages must be looked at jointly. They all give arguments in favor of a non-\nmonodimensional view of sustainability. Too much information undoubtedly goes against\nreadability and public impact. But trying to put too much information in a too restrictive set of\nnumbers, or even in only one number can symetrically leads to lose important points of the\nphenomenon that we try to capture. \nOn the whole, problems with sustainability measurement are large, but we need to offer\nsolutions, how imperfect they can be. We shall formulate five recommandations in this\ndirection. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n265\nRecommendation 1: Sustainability assessment requires a well-identified sub-dashboard of the\nglobal dashboard to be recommended by the Commission.\nFirst of all, the complexity of the task strongly advocates in favor of treating it separately\nfrom the other issue that has been considered by the commission, i.e. the monetary or non\nmonetary dimensions of current well-being. This recommendation to separate the two issues\nmight look trivial. Yet it deserves emphasis, because some existing approaches fail to adopt\nthis principle, leading to potentially confusing messages. The confusion reaches a peak when\none tries to combine these two dimensions into a single indicator. This criticism applies not\nonly to composite indices, but also to the notion of green GDP. To take an analogy, when\ndriving a car, a meter that weighed up in one single value the current speed of the vehicle and\nthe remaining level of gasoline would not be of any help to the driver. Both pieces of\ninformation are critical and need to be displayed in distinct, clearly visible areas of the\ndashboard. \nRecommendation 2: The distinctive feature of all components of this sub-dashboard should be\ninterpretable as variations of some “stocks”. \nSecond, on a complicate subject where many misunderstandings can take place, it is good\npractice to first start by elaborating a common language or a common general framework.\nThe one that we have tried to emphasize is the so-called “stock-based” or “capital-based” or\n“wealth-based” approaches to sustainability. The argument is that, ultimately, the\nsustainability issue is about how much stocks of resources we leave to future periods or future\ngenerations, and the question is whether we leave enough of these to maintain opportunity\nsets at least as large as the one we have inherited of. Saying this does not entail any a priori\nlimitation in the list of these assets that matter for future well-being. Quite the contrary: their\nlist can be extended as far as possible. Assessments of sustainability must be made on\ncomplete inventories of these stocks, and a good assessment of how they are currently\nchanging, and of what are their expected paths of evolution. On the purely economic side,\nsuch an inventory is provided by capital accounts. Some solutions also exist for the\nmeasurement of human capital, both in terms of stocks or in terms of net flows. On the\nenvironnemental side, such an large scale inventory has been made for instance in the contect\nof initiatives such as the Millenium Ecosystems Assessment coordinated by the United\nNations between 2001 and 2005. “Social capital” is also another dimension that is important\nto consider even if, on this point, quantification is a much more difficult issue.  \nJust to illustrate the relevance of this stock approach and the way it articulates to the\nmeasurement of current well-being, let’s recall again how it very neatly solves one of the most\nwell-known criticisms of standard GDP, the fact that, viewd as a well-being indicator, it can\nsend the aberrant message that a natural catastrophe is a blessing for the economy, because of\nthe additional economic activity generated by repairs. If we are able to apply it in a correct\nway, the stock approach will clearly recorded as a form of exceptional loss of natural or\nphysical capital. The resulting increase in economic activity that can be induced by the\ncatastrophe has a positive value only insofar as it helps to restore the initial level of the capital\nstock. It does not contribute to current well-being: without the catastrophe, people would have\nenjoyed more pleasant activities. It only helps to avoid a reduction in future well-being caused\nby the greater scarcity of these capital goods. \nTo conclude on this point, we must also recall that phrasing the issue of sustainability in\nterms of preservation of some “capital” goods does not mean that one consider that these\n\n266\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\ngoods must be managed or traded as ordinary capital goods. Economists indifferently use the\nterms of wealth or capital for all forms of goods that can be transferred from one period to\nanother, without any prior upon whether these goods should be privately or collectively\nowned, and upon whether their management should be fully left to market forces or not. To\navoid such a misunderstanding, we have tried here to retain the more neutral term of wealth as\nmuch as possible. Now, whatever the words that are chosen, it should be possible to agree that\nthe question of sustainability can be formulated as the question of knowing whether we pass\nenough of all these components of wealth to future periods or future generations. This is the\nreason why we have chosen to adopt here this formulation of the problem. \nRecommendation 3: A monetary index of sustainability has its place in a sustainability\ndashboard, but under the current state of the art, it should remain essentially focused on\neconomic aspects of sustainability.\nNow, this stock-based approach to sustainability can in turn be broken down into two\nversions. One version would just look at variations in each stock separately with a view to\ndoing whatever is necessary to keep it from declining or at least to keep it above some critical\nthreshold beyond which further reductions would be highly detrimental to future well-being.\nOr one could attempt to summarize all stock variations in synthetic figures. \nThis second track is the one followed by so-called “extended wealth”, “inclusive wealth”\nor “adjusted savings” approaches, which share the idea of converting all these assets into a\nmonetary equivalent. We have discussed at length the potential of such an approach, but also\nseveral of its limitations. In certain conditions, it offers the ability to anticipate many forms of\nnon-sustainability, but the requirements for such a capacity are extremely high. This is\nbecause the aggregation required by this approach cannot be based on market values: market\nprices are nonexistent for quite a large number of the assets that matter for future well-being.\nEven when they are available, there is no guarantee that they adequately reflect how these\ndifferent assets will matter for future well-being. In the absence of such price messages, we\nhave to turn to imputations, which raise both the normative and informational difficulties that\nhave been outlined in our liminary messages. \nAll this suggests staying with a more modest approach, i.e. focusing the monetary\naggregation on items for which reasonable valuation techniques exist, such as physical\ncapital, human capital and fossil resources. This more or less corresponds to the hard part of\n“adjusted net savings” as computed by the World Bank and further developed by several\nauthors. “Greening” this index more intensively is of course a relevant objective, and we can\nkeep it on the agenda. We know what kind of analytical apparatus would be required for\naccomplishing this: large-scale projection models of interactions between the environment\nand the economy, including a proper treatment of the uncertainty that exists concerning this\ninteraction by resorting to scenarios based on different relative prices as well as, possibly, on\n“stress tests”. But, meanwhile, we must focus this indicator essentially on what it does\nrelatively well, i.e. the assessment of the “economic” component of sustainability, that is, the\nassessment of whether or not countries overconsume their economic wealth. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n267\nBox 3: Physical and other non-monetary indicators: which ones to choose?\nThe commission’s general position has been to avoid formulating definitive turnkey proposals on any\nthe different issues it has raised. All proposals rather intend to stimulate further debate. This is all the more\ntrue in the domain of physical sustainability indicators where the expertise of specialists from other\ndisciplines is crucial and was only indirectly represented in the commission’s composition. \nSome suggestions can however be made, in connection with conclusions of some recent related\nreports. \nIn 2008, a OECD/UNECE/Eurostat working group has produced a report on measuring sustainable\ndevelopment whose messages have several points in common with ours. It strongly advocates the stock-\nbased approach to sustainability as the relevant way of structuring a micro-dashboard of sustainability\nindicators gathering both stock and flow variables. It also suggests a line of demarcation between\ndeterminants of ‘economic’ well-being (those that are the most directly amenable to monetary evaluation)\nand the determinants of ‘foundational’ well-being, among which four couples of stock/flow environmental\nindicators  devoted respectively to global warming, other forms of atmospheric pollution, quality of water\nand biodiversity. The details and positions of these indicators in the dashboard can be visualized (in bold)\non the table below. \nSmall set of sustainable development indicators proposed by the UNECE/OECD/Eurostat \nworking group on sustainability measurement\nSource: UNECE/OECD/Eurostat (2008)\nMore recently, the French Economic, Social and environmental Council (CESE) has produced a report\n(Le Clézio, 2009) whose initial aim was the assessment of the Ecological Footprint but that has more\nwidely explored the different tracks available for quantifying sustainability. It has the same messages as\nthe current report concerning the limits of this EF index, and the fact that most of the relevant information\nthat it conveys is more directly and more neatly reflected in one of its subcomponents, the carbon footprint.\nAs a consequence, it strongly advocates in favor of this index. Compared to Global GHG emissions\nsuggested in the OECD/UNECE/Eurostat Dashboard presented above, the Carbon Footprint has the\nadvantage of being expressed in this ‘footprint’ unit that is intuitively so appealing and that has made the\nsuccess of the EF. In addition to this, this CESE report has suggested emphasizing the other physical\nindicators already present in the large international dashboards such as the one elaborated for the European\nStrategy for Sustainable Development whose complete list is given in appendix 1. Some of them are those\nalready quoted in the OECD/UNECE/Eurostat dashboard. \nAs far as climate change is concerned, some other indicators can be considered. Direct observation of\nmean temperature is one possibility but not the best suited, because it has a tendency to run behind the\nmain components of climate change and because there can always be  disagreements about the causes of\ntemperature rises, hence about their  permanent or transient character. Consequently, climatologists prefer\nIndicator domain\nStock indicator\nFlow indicator\nFoundational \nwell-being\nHealth-adjusted life expectancy\nIndex of changes in agespecific mortality and \nmorbidity (place holder)\nPercentage of population with post-\nsecondary education\nEnrolment in post-secondary education\nTemperature deviations from Normals\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nGround-level ozone and fine particulate \nconcentrations\nSmog-forming pollutant emissions\nQuality-adjusted water availability\nNutrient loadings to water bodies\nFragmentation of natural habitats\nConversion of natural habitats to other uses\nEconomic \nwell-being\nReal per capita net foreign financial \nasset holdings\nReal per capita investment in foreign financial \nassets\nReal per capita produced capital\nReal per capita net investment in produced capital\nReal per capita human capital\nReal per capita net investment in human capital\nReal per capita natural capita\nReal per capita net depletion of natural capital\nReserves of energy resources\nDepletion of energy resources\nReserves of mineral resources\nDepletion of mineral resources\nTimber resource stocks\nDepletion of timber resources\nMarine resource stocks\nDepletion of marine resources\n\n268\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nto make use of a thermodynamic concept, the CO2 radiative forcing,  that measures the earth energy\nimbalance created by the action of CO2  as a greenhouse gas. \nAlternatively, it is possible to directly use a notion of CO2 remaining budget: according to\nclimatologists, there is an upper limit of 0.75 trillion tonnes of carbon that might be  discharged in the\natsmosphere if the risk of  temperatures exceeding 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels is limited to one-\nin-four, this upperbound at 2°C being largely accepted among climate experts as a \"tipping point” opening\nthe door to unstoppable feedback effects (methane from melting permafrost , CO2 and methane from\ndecaying tropical forests ,all sorts of greenhouse gases released by saturated warming oceans,  etc...). Of\nthis 0.75 total budget, emissions to 2008 have already consumed circa 0.5. Hence the importance of\nmonitoring this remaining CO2 budget. The attractiveness of this indicator is to be strongly consistent with\nthe stock-based approach to sustainability. It can be also rephrased in the very expressive terms of a\ncountdown index, i.e. the time that remains until exhaustion of this stock, under the assumption of\nemissions remaining on their current trend. This kind of representation is often used for other forms of\nexhaustible resources. \nStill other indirect indicators of global warming are the regression of permanent ice or the oceanic pH.\nThe regression of permanent ice has the advantage of being an advanced  one and to be directly related to\nmanifest effects. The oceanic pH increases with the amount of CO2 that is naturally pumped into the\noceans. A consequence of this increase is a decrease in the quantity of phytoplancton, which is itself  a\ncarbon sink no less important than the forests. One may therefore say that the physical sink (sea water\ndissolving atmospheric CO2) destroys the biological one. This is the reason why the oceanic pH appears to\nbe another good tentative indicator of climate change, pointing to one of the most vicious feedback effects.\nAmong criteria for choosing between all the indicators, two are of particular importance. One is their\nappropriability by the public, the other is the capacity of declining them at national or even subnational\nlevels: in this respect, the carbon footprint has quite a lot of advantages.\nAs far as biodiversity is concerned, the issue is currently under review by the TEEB group (“the\neconomics of the environment and biodiversity”) working at the initiative of the European Union\n(Sukhdev, 2008) and it has been also recently addressed by a report by the French Conseil d’Analyse\nStratégique, in this case with the idea of pushing as far as possible the monetization of this dimension\n(Chevassus-au-Louis, 2009). The reason for this search of monetary equivalent is essentially that it may\nfoster incorporation of this dimension in investment choices: many public decisions such as building a new\nmotorway imply some potential biodiversity loss through fragmentation of natural habitats. But the report\nprovides also a very detailed and technical review of available physical measures of biodiversity, to which\nthe reader is referred for further information.  \nAt last, moving away from environmental preoccupations, but still on the “non-monetary” side, one\nimportant issue is the issue of social capital and “institutional assets” that we transmit to future\ngenerations. One will have noticed that the UNECE/OECD/Eurostat dashboard presented above did not\npropose any indicator of this kind, not because the question is not relevant, but mainly because of lack of\nconsensus about the way to measure it. Subgroup 3 was not in a position to explore this question further,\nbut efforts along this direction remain undoubtedly necessary.  \nRecommendation 4: The environmental aspects of sustainability deserve a separate follow-up \nbased on a well-chosen set of physical indicators. \nAs far as environmental sustainability is concerned, the limitations of monetary\napproaches do not mean that efforts to monetize damages to the environment are no longer\nneeded: it is well known that fully opposing any kind of monetization often leads to policies\nthat act as if environmental goods had no value at all. The point is that we are far from being\nable to construct monetary values for environmental goods that at the macro level can be\nreasonably compared to market prices of other capital assets. Given our state of ignorance, the\nprecautionary principle legitimates a separate follow-up of these environmental goods.\nIn fact, the fundamental reasons for a separate treatment of these environmental issues\ndirectly stem from our liminary messages: these are the items for which projections are the\nmost difficult to produce, with strong technological uncertainties, a high difficulty to\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n269\nappreciate how they are likely to be valued by future generations and a separate follow-up of\nthe corresponding physical of indicators can be viewed, at least at this stage, as a simple way\nto this need of a specific treatment. In addition, these goods often have this characteristic of\nbeing global public goods, as it is the case for  climate. All these elements go in the same\ndirection of favoring a separate follow-up. \nNow, what are the stock/flow indicators that are the best suited for this separate follow-up ?\nThe ecological footprint was one of the options for this separate follow-up. In particular, in\ncontrast to net adjusted savings, it essentially focuses on contributions to global non-\nsustainability, with the message that the main responsibility lies with the developed countries.\nYet the group has taken notice of its limitations, and in particular that it is far from being a pure\nphysical indicator of pressure on the environment: it retains some aggregation rules that may be\nproblematic. In fact, it appears that much of the information that it conveys about national\ncontributions to non-sustainability is imbedded in a simpler indicator, the carbon footprint,\nwhich is therefore one good candidate for monitoring humanity’s pressure on the climate. \nNow, on this general issue of physical indicators, a group of economists cannot claim for\nany comparative  advantage. The discussion of which stock measures should be ideally\nincluded in the micro-dashboard we are calling for necessarily requires other forms of\nexpertise, before being submitted to public discussion. Box 3 just gives some examples of\nhow the same problem has been treated recently by equivalent groups or commissions, or\nsuggest some additional tracks for the specific case of global warming. \nIn short, our pragmatic compromise is to suggest a small dashboard, firmly rooted in the\nlogic of the “stock” approach to sustainability, which would combine:\n– An indicator more or less derived from the extended wealth approach, “greened” as far\nas possible on the basis of currently available knowledge, but whose main function,\nhowever, would be to send warning messages concerning “economic” non-\nsustainability. This economic non-sustainability could be due to low savings or low\ninvestment in education, or to insufficient reinvestment of income generated by the\nextraction of fossil resources (for countries that strongly rely on this source of income).\n– A set of well-chosen physical indicators, which would focus on dimensions of\nenvironmental sustainability that are either already important or could become so in the\nfuture, and that remain difficult to capture in monetary terms.\nThe points of convergence between this scenario and conclusions reached by some of the\nother reports mentioned in Box 3 are reassuring: they suggest that, from the relatively\nconfused situation that was described in section 2, we are steadily moving towards a more\nconsensual framework for the understanding of sustainability issues11.\nA subsidiary question concerns a user’s guide to such a dashboard. A warning should be\ngiven that no limited set of figures can pretend to forecast the sustainable or unsustainable\ncharacter of a highly complex system with certainty. The purpose is, rather, to have a set of\nindicators that give an “alert” to situations that pose a high risk of non-sustainability.\nWhatever we do, however, dashboards and indices are only one part of the story. Most of the\nefforts involved in assessing sustainability have to focus on increasing our knowledge about\nhow the economy and the environment interact now and are likely to interact in the future.\n11.\nSome other points of convergence can be found in reactions by the European Environmental Agency to the\nfirst draft of this commission’s summary report (European Environmental Agency, 2009).\n\n270\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nAppendix 1: Reviewed list of European sustainable development indicators\n(Source: Eurostat, 2007)\nHEME 1: SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Key SDS objective: Economic prosperity\n* Indicators under development. \nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTheme 1: Socio Economic Development\n1.

This raises\nchallenges for measurement that go well beyond those pertaining to natural and\nenvironmental resources and that extend to all types of assets that are not traded in markets.\nThis is the case of human capital.\nHuman capital refers to the knowledge, skills and attributes that are embodied in each\nperson and that facilitate the creation of different forms of well-being (Keeley, 2008). Adam\nSmith talked about human capital more than three centuries ago arguing that economic\nactivity is fuelled not by workers as a collective mass but by the “acquired and useful abilities\nof all inhabitants or members of society” and that these abilities, once attained, stand as “a\ncapital fixed and realised, as it were, in his person”. Since the second half of the XXth\ncentury, human capital has played an increasingly important role in discussions about the\ndeterminants of economic growth, poverty and inequality.\nThe boundaries of what is conventionally labelled as human capital are not always well-\ndefined. The formal education system obviously plays a critical role in sustaining the\naccumulation of human capital, but this accumulation can also reflect learning processes\ndeveloped outside schools, such as early childhood education and on-the job training. Health\ncan also be regarded as part of human capital, although the challenges posed by its\nmeasurement are distinct from those relating to skills and competences. \nThe benefits of human capital are also broad: they are both economic and social, and they\nmay accrue both the person making this investment and to the community of which they are\npart. On the economic side, the benefits of human capital investment take the form of higher\nincome and earnings capacity for the individual making this investment: these private returns\nto education have increased strongly over the past few decades in many OECD countries,\ncontributing to wider income inequalities between people with different education. At the\naggregate level, investment in human capital is also a critical factor for economic growth, for\nthe simple reason that this growth is, more than ever, based on technical advances that\ndemand workers always more skilled and qualified. Investment in human capital also delivers\nsocial returns, such as higher life-expectancy for more educated people, lower undesired\nfertility in less-developed countries, and greater participation in civic and social life. \nBecause of this range of payoffs, and of its links to a variety of other fields (such as health,\npaid work and caring), the concept of human capital enters contemporary debates in a variety\nof forms: as a driver of economic growth and innovation; as an investment to secure greater\naccess to jobs, higher income and lower poverty; and as one of the assets that should be\npreserved and developed – on par with natural capital and other types of resources – to secure\nsustainable development.\n\n274\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nMeasuring human capital: from indicators to accounts\nDespite its importance, the measurement of human capital remains elusive. Of course,\nphysical indicators (such as the average years of schooling for the population of working age)\nexist, but they have important limits: for example, they ignore differences in competencies\namong people with the same educational attainment; they disregards what people learn\noutside school, both on the job and through exposure to more accessible and extensive\ninformation flows; and they neglect the amount of resources (in terms of both time and\nmoney) that feeds these learning processes. Direct measures of people’s competencies,\nadministered through standardised tests, also provide important indicators of the “quality” of\nthe competencies gained, but those currently available are mainly limited to students of a\ngiven age (15 years old, in the case of the OECD’s Programme on International Student\nAssessment). While these physical indicators allow benchmarking countries’ performance in\nthe educational field from a variety of perspectives, they lack a framework that allows relating\nto each other the various elements that shape the accumulation of human capital and assessing\ntheir contribution through a common yardstick.\nWhile the task of developing such a framework may have appeared far-fetched only a few\nyears ago, it is feasible today (Fraumeni, 2008). Comprehensive and reliable accounts on\nhuman capital can be constructed using the same accounting framework that is used for\nstandard economic statistics. Practical guidance to the construction of these accounts for a\nvariety of non-market activities is provided by a report prepared by a panel of the US National\nAcademy of Sciences (Abraham and Mackie, 2005). This report stressed the importance of\ndeveloping independent measures of both the inputs and the outputs of non-market activities,\nand of quantifying both the values and the volumes of each of the two sides of these\naccounts.12 In the human capital field, these accounts could initially be limited to formal\neducation, and then be extended in steps to other dimensions, such as the investments made to\nprepare children for formal schooling and that made to maintain and develop the\ncompetencies of people of working-age through on-the-job training and adult education.\n“Formal education”, in the perspective of non-market accounts, encompasses the joint use of\ninputs by households and educational establishments to produce educational services, as\nopposed to the more narrow definition of the education industry in the national accounts,\nwhich largely ignores the role of private households in the production of these services.\nA comprehensive satellite account for formal education would integrate values of both the\ninputs into these learning processes, and of the outputs produced. This requires indentifying\nthe most salient items entering the two sides of the accounts and solving specific\nmeasurement problems.\n•\nOn the inputs side, the most important categories are the monetary expenditures of\nboth households and educational institutions for paid work (teachers and support\npersonnel), intermediate inputs (materials such as books) and capital inputs (school\nbuilding, equipment and software). On top of these expenditures, the unpaid time\ndevoted to education by the students themselves, by their parents providing home-\n12.\nWhile, for market transactions, the two sides of the accounts are expected to balance out (with the statistical\ndiscrepancy providing an indicator of the overall quality of these estimates), large imbalances are possible in the\ncase of non-market accounts; this may reflect failures in the measuring of all relevant inputs or in the pricing of\nvarious outputs.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n275\nsupport, and by other people and associations who may support the learning of\nstudents with specific difficulties or in special areas (e.g. mentors, tutors) constitutes\ninputs to the production of education services. The valuation of these unpaid time-\ninputs requires, on the volume side, good estimates of how people allocate their\ntime (from either administrative records, for the time spent by students in classes, or\nfrom time-use surveys); and, on the value side, estimates of appropriate accounting\nprices for these inputs. According to Abraham and Mackie (2005) non-market\ninputs that could have been provided by a third party should ideally be valued based\non their replacement costs (e.g. the time spent by parents in helping their kids to\nperform their home-work could be valued at the wage of a private teacher providing\nthe same support, possibly adjusted for differences in the skills and efforts between\nthe paid-service provider and the nonmarket worker); while inputs for which own\ntime is required, such as students’ time in classes, should ideally be valued based on\nopportunity costs (possibly adjusted for the value of enjoyment derived from non-\nmarket work).13 \n•\nOn the output side, the value of education services produced is measured as the\naddition to human capital through education. Human capital will increase as a\nconsequence of education if the latter leads to higher earnings and productivity on\nthe workplace of better educated people. Other items that could also be included on\nthe output side are the effect of education on non-market productivity (such as the\ngreater rewards from some leisure activities enjoyed by more educated people) and,\nideally, the returns of education for society at large, such as those that flow from\ncreating citizens that are better informed, more tolerant, and more willing and\ncapable of interacting with others.\nValuing human capital stocks: the discounted life-time income approach\nIn practice, comprehensive accounts of human capital, even when limited to formal\neducation, would need to be developed in steps. From a sustainable development perspective,\nthe immediate focus of research is likely to be measuring the total stock of human capital per\ncapita, and to monitor how this stock changes over time. Different approaches have been used\nfor this goal. One approach derives measures of the stock of human capital as a “residual”\nfrom an accounting identity. For example, World Bank’s estimates of “intangible capital” are\ncomputed as the difference between a total measure of the capital stock (the discounted sum\nof average consumption expenditure over the past three years, summed over an horizon of 25\nyears) and estimates of the values of natural resources, physical capital and financial holdings\n(World Bank, 2005). Similarly, other authors have measured human capital by estimating,\nfirst, a “return of human capital” (the difference between Net National Income in a given year\nand net returns on fixed, financial, and natural resources, i.e. resource rents); and, second, by\nmeasuring the stock of human capital as the present value of these human capital returns\n(Greaker, 2007). However, these “indirect” estimates of the stock of human capital are\naffected by errors in measuring all the terms entering these identities; also, by construction,\n13.\nThe extent to which society fosters and values the learning of youths, and the peer effects of other students\n(which are forms of social capital) may also be considered as inputs that enhances students’ learning experiences\nand opportunities; monetary valuation of these effects, however, do not exist.\n\n276\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nthey reflect the assumption that some monetary measure of income or consumption provides\nas a suitable proxy of human well-being. 14\nWhile these approaches may be useful for research purposes, most practitioners in the field\nof human capital measurement favour a “direct” measure based on the discounted life-time\nincome of each individual. This approach, pioneered by Jorgenson and Fraumeni for the\nUnited States (1989, 1992)15, relies on data on the observed earnings of people with various\nlevels of educational, as well as on information on the number of people by age and gender,\ntheir highest level of education attained and their participation in the labour force. In theory,\nthe wage premium for people with different education may signal their innate competencies,\nand the sorting of people that occurs through the schooling system, rather than the effect of\neducation in improving people’s productivity. In practice, the view that these wage premia\nmainly reflect the effects of education in enhancing people’s productivity is shared by most\nresearchers in this field.\nEmpirical estimates of human capital based on variants of the discounted life-time income\napproach already exist for several OECD countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand,\nNorway, Sweden and the United States. While these estimate differ in a number of respects\n(e.g. the population covered, the inclusion of non-market income), and assumptions (e.g. the\nfuture pace of real earnings growth by education level, the rate used to discount these future\nincome flows), they agree in showing that the value of human capital is substantial, and much\nlarger than that of conventional types of capital: in other terms, currently available measures\nof a country’s total wealth, as available from national balance-sheets produced by national\nstatistical offices, omit the largest component of this wealth.16 These approaches based on\ndiscounted life-time income also allow describing the composition of human capital across\neducational attainment levels, gender and age (Table 1); and to decompose the pace of human\ncapital accumulation in terms of various drivers such as population ageing, migration and\nchanges educational attainment of various cohorts. Aggregate estimates of human capital can\nalso be tested for their sensitivity to various assumptions about future earnings growth and\ndiscount rates.\n14.\nArrow et al (2008) provide proxy estimates of human capital for China and the United States measured as the\nproduct of its total quantity (a function of the average education attainment of each country and of their adult\npopulation) and its rental price (the discounted sum of each country’s wage bill per unit of human capital\nemployed, cumulated over the average number of working-years remaining). Based on these estimates, for both\nChina and the United States, the increase in human and reproducible (fixed and financial) capital greatly exceeds\nthe loss from the depletion of natural capital.\n15.\nThis was the conclusion reached at a workshop on the measurement of human capital organised by the\nOECD and the Fondazione Giovanni Agnelli on 3 - 4 November 2008 in Turin, Italy.\n16.\nFor example, estimates presented at the Turin workshop, suggest that the value of human capital (excluding\nnon-market income) is about 1.7 times that of net fixed produced assets in the United States, 3.4 times in Australia,\n4 times in Canada, and six times in Norway. Because of differences in assumptions and population coverage, these\nestimates are not comparable across countries.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n277\nDeveloping human capital accounts would provide a number of payoffs. First, they\nprovide a single monetary estimate of human capital, which can be compared across countries\nand over time. Second, the possibility to decompose changes in the value of human capital\ninto various drivers, would also allow projecting its evolution in the future, for example when\nolder cohorts of less educated people are replaced by more educated ones. Last, by looking at\nthe full range of inputs into education, they would favour policy dialogue between the various\nministries and agencies that share responsibilities in this field, in particular when these\naccounts are extended beyond formal education. Human capital accounts based on individual\ndata could also allow measuring inequalities in its distribution, and to address concerns linked\nto equity in access and outcomes for people with various characteristics. The potential of\noffered by better measures in this filed is huge; to realise it will require involving the\nstatistical community in individual countries, undertaking investment to produce these\nestimates at regular intervals, and favouring cross-country collaboration through a phased\ntime-plan (Fraumeni, 2008). \nTable A.3.1.: Estimates of the value of human capital in Australia\nSource: Estimates presented at the workshop on the measurement of human capital organised by the OECD and the\nFondazione Giovanni Agnelli, 3- 4 November 2008, Turin.\n1981\n1986\n1991\n1996\n2001\nHigher degree \n42 917\n52 562\n92 185\n127 009\n161 362\nBachelor degree \n244 123\n315 558\n448 212\n607 439\n733 190\nSkilled labour \n840 709\n943 680\n1,039949 \n1 143 195\n1 259 752\nUnskilled labour \n1,540987 \n1 685 260\n1 889 659\n1 950 974\n1 957 450\nTotal \n2 668 736\n2 997 060\n3 470 005\n3 828 618\n4 111 754\nHigher degree \n9 485\n14 002\n30 389\n55 730\n90 579\nBachelor degree \n106 458\n160 347\n305 251\n489 443\n663 789\nSkilled labour \n349 437\n420 986\n429 201\n488 993\n553 664\nUnskilled labour \n1 251 790\n1 353 062\n1 569 421\n1 623 914\n1 616 411\nTotal \n1 717 170\n1 948 398\n2 334 262\n2 658 080\n2 924 442\nTotal \n4 385 906\n4 945 457\n5 804 266\n6 486 698\n7 036 196\nMemorandum Item\nProduced capital\n..\n..\n..\n..\n2 057 912\nRatio of human capital \n..\n..\n..\n..\n3.4\n  to fixed assets\nEntire population\nMale \nFemale \n\n278\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nAppendix 3: Adjusted Net Savings and environmental assets: \nsome robustness checks\nAs emphasized in the text, the relevance of the ANS approach crucially depends on what\nis counted (the different forms of capital passed through to future generations), namely what\nis included in the “extended wealth”, and on the price used to count and aggregate (what is\ncounted) in a context of imperfect valuation by markets. This appendix examines how the\nindex is sensitive to variants of both kinds, focussing on natural resources. \nShortcomings and improvements: the “what”\nOne major shortcoming of the ANS produced by the World Bank is the fact that the\nadjustment for environmental degradation is limited to global pollution damages from carbon\ndioxide emissions. The authors acknowledge that “the calculations are not comprehensive in\nthat they do not include some important sources of environmental degradation such as\nunderground water depletion, unsustainable fisheries, and soil degradation” (Where is the\nwealth of Nations, 2006, pp. 154), and a fortiori biodiversity loss. “ This results from the lack\nof internationally comparable data, rather than intended omissions”.\nFigure A.3.1: Additional air pollution damages in France: substantial level effects\n0,00\n2,00\n4,00\n6,00\n8,00\n10,00\n12,00\n14,00\n16,00\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\nANS in % GNI\nCO2 20$/t 1995\nGHG 20$/t 1995\nGHG 20$/t 1995 + Air Pollutants (€ 1995)\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n279\nTo perform sensitivity tests according to the scope of pollution damages covered, we focus\non France and replicate what is done in Nourry (2008). We extend CO2 damages to all\ngreenhouse gazes (GHG) expressed in tons of equivalent CO2 and replicate the incorporation\nof additional damages linked to Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Oxide (Nox), Carbon\nMonoxide (CO) and Volatile Organic Components (VOC) in line with Noury (2008), and the\ndamages linked to particulate matters (PM10) emissions (World Bank). The marginal damage\ncosts proxies are based on previous studies by Rabl and Spadaro (2001) and calculations by\nNoury (2008): 5245 €/t of So2, 8093 €/t of Nox, 970 €/t of CO, 5762 €/t of VOC and 7265 €/\nt of PM10.  \nThose calculations lead to substantial changes in the level of the final ANS, as illustrated\nfor France on figure A.3.1. However, France still faces a comfortable positive value of its\nANS indicator. On average, the “augmented” ANS is 3 percentage points below the standard\nANS calculations (excluding PM10), namely slightly more than 9% instead of an initial\n12.5% of GNI.  \nShortcomings and Improvements: relative prices\nAnother key ingredient of the World Bank’s estimates of ANS is their reliance on current\nprices for natural exhaustible resources. In theory, the use of market prices to evaluate flows\nand stocks is only warranted in a context of complete, competitive markets, which is clearly\nnot the case in reality, and in particular not for natural resources, where externalities and\nuncertainties are paramount. In particular, market prices for fossil energy sources and other\nminerals have tended, in recent years, to fluctuate widely, causing significant swings in\nmeasures of ANS based on current market prices17.\nMoreover, whether competitive or not, the World Bank approach takes current prices as\nrelevant metrics for all future periods. But those prices cannot be expected to remain stable.\nAccording to the Hotelling rule, they should increase as the resources are becoming scarcer.\nConsequently, those changes would have to be incurred as capital gains by exporting\ncountries and corresponding losses for importing ones (while being neutral at the worldwide\nlevel), as highlighted by Arrow et ali. (2008).  \nAs for pricing environmental degradations, things turn out to be even trickier. Indeed, in\nthe absence of any market valuation, accounting prices must be evaluated by modeling long\nterm consequences of given changes in environmental capital and how they impact\nprospective well-being. This point is elaborated more systematically in the text. We shall only\nexamine here by how much the ANS can be sensitive to alternative numerical values of these\nprices, focussing on the pricing of CO2 emissions, namely the estimation of the marginal\nsocial cost of one additional ton of carbon. Debates have been lively on that topic but as a\nconsequence, estimations of the good price for carbon have been flourishing. As\nsustainability always involves a view of the future, pricing CO2 emissions is only partially a\nproblem of what CO2 emissions costs now, but rather how much those should be priced\ntomorrow.\n17.\nAlternatively, the El-Serafy’s method could have been used. Dietz and Neumayer (2004, pages 284-285)\nnoticed that the WB calculus leads to extremely large negative values of ANS for some oil exporting countries at\nsome periods (up to -30% for Saudi Arabia in the 1970s), meaning a quasi-exhaustion of this country’s wealth\nwithin only a few decades. The El-Serafy’s method would have produced much more realistic values.\n\n280\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nIn the following graphs, we displayed revised values of the ANS according to different\nmarginal social costs that have been used or proposed. The original release of the ANS\nretained a value of 20$ (1995) per ton of carbon (deflated for subsequent years by GDP\ndeflator). A recent update by Arrow et ali. (2008) proposed a value of 50$ (2005) per ton of\ncarbon. In France, the government has been involved in that topic for several years as public\nchoice for public  investments does take into account the environmental costs induced in the\ncost/benefits tradeoff (Boiteux and Baumstrark 1994 and 2001). A study led by Boiteux\nproposed a value of 100€ per ton of carbon in 2000 (i.e 27€ per ton of CO2). A recent update\nof this report (Quinet, 2008) targeted a value of roughly 370€ per ton of carbon in 2030, with\na 4% discount rate. Proceeding backward, it provides us with a value of 45€ per ton of CO2 in\n2010.\nThose substantial differences in prices do not alter that much the overall ANS, as shown in\nthe graphs. Indeed, the main differences appear when doubling the price from the 50$ per ton\nin Arrow et al. (2008) to the 100€ per ton in the French official assessment. Pricing\nassumptions affect only marginally the overall level of the ANS.\nThe interesting part of the 2008 Quinet report is the projected path of the cost of CO2\nemissions. Assuming a soft recovering from the value of 27€ per ton of CO2 in 2000 to the\ntarget of 100€ per ton of CO2 in 2030, we are able to compute several forecasts of the ANS,\nalong different scenarios. \nTwo sets of assumptions are addressed here, as an example. First, the ANS (excluding the\nCO2 damage part) could continue from 2006 following the trend observed since 1990 or\nreturn smoothly to a (supposed) long-run value (equal to the average ANS on 1980-2006).\nSecondly, the intensity ratio (CO2 emissions per units of GNI) may be still decreasing over\nthat horizon at the pace observed since 1990, or remain constant at this 2006 level (less\nprobably). Those assumptions therefore leave us with 4 scenarios, under the same path for the\nCO2 price. \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n281\nFigure A.3.2.: Valuation effects for CO2 damages: France\nFigure A.3.3: Valuation effects for CO2 damages: USA\n8,00\n9,00\n10,00\n11,00\n12,00\n13,00\n14,00\n15,00\n16,00\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\nANS \nin % GNI\n20$/t 1995\n50$/t 2005\n100€/t 2000\n370€/t 2030\n0,00\n2,00\n4,00\n6,00\n8,00\n10,00\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\nANS \nin % GNI\n20$/t 1995\n50$/t 2005\n100€/t 2000\n370€/t 2030\n\n282\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nFigure A.3.4: ANS forecasts along different scenarios: France, 100 €/t CO2 2030\nFigure A.3.5: ANS forecasts along different scenarios: USA, 100 €/t CO2 2030\n0,00\n2,00\n4,00\n6,00\n8,00\n10,00\n12,00\n14,00\n16,00\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nANS in % GNI\nANS trend, CO2 intensity constant\nANS trend, CO2 intensity trend\nANS Long-run, CO2 intensity constant\nANS Long-run, CO2 intensity trend\n-4,00\n-2,00\n0,00\n2,00\n4,00\n6,00\n8,00\n10,00\n12,00\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nANS in % GNI\nANS trend, CO2 intensity constant\nANS trend, CO2 intensity trend\nANS Long-run, CO2 intensity constant\nANS Long-run, CO2 intensity trend\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n283\nHere again, the most striking result is that we need the twin strongly pessimistic\n(unrealistic?) assumptions of steady CO2 intensity ratio and decreasing trend in gross saving\nto see the USA ending up as unsustainable around 2020 according to the ANS indicator.\nUpper-level criticisms \nAt least two aspects have been left aside so far and would need further elaboration.\nFirst, we offered no treatment of uncertainty, a problem which is not fully dealt with by\nthe latest improvements in valuation methods (see, in particular, Henry and Henry, 2002;\nWeitzman, 2007; Heal, 2008). Section 3 elaborates more on that. Secondly, while computing\nANS per country, we leave out the very international nature of sustainability. Indeed, one may\nfeel uneasy in front of the message conveyed by the ANS regarding resources (e.g. oil)\nexporting countries. In such exporting countries, unsustainability only comes from an\ninsufficient rate of reinvestment of the rents generated by the exploitation of the natural\nresource, and “over-consumption” by importing countries is not an issue at all. Developed\ncountries, generally less endowed in natural resources but richer in human and physical\ncapital than developing ones, would then unduly appear sustainable.\nAs a consequence, a case has been made by some authors (Proops et al., 1999) for\nimputing consumption of exhaustible resources to their final consumers, i.e. the importing\ncountries. In fact, if scarcities were fully reflected in the prices at which these exhaustible\nresources are sold on international markets, there would be no reason for doing such a\ncorrection. “Dissavings” of worldwide natural resources by final consumers is already taken\ninto account in their commercial balances and it is indeed the responsibility of the exporting\ncountry to reinvest a sufficient share of the corresponding income in other assets to warrant its\nown sustainability. Nevertheless, when prices are non competitive, this result is no more\nvalid. If the importing country is able to pay its imports less than would be required for\nefficiency, it will have a responsibility in global non-sustainability that is not captured by the\nmoney-value of its imports. Low prices allow this country to overconsume and to transfer the\nlong-term costs of this over-consumption to the exporting country. A discrepancy appears\nbetween this country’s own sustainability and its contribution to worldwide sustainability. It is\nprecisely this discrepancy that explains the global inefficiency of the consumption path.\nIn fact, the valuation of global pollution damages raises a very similar problem. Do we aim\nat measuring the sustainability of well-being for one specific country, or the contribution of a\ngiven country to the global unsustainability? The difference between these two stances is\nexemplified in the treatment of CO2 emissions by the World Bank and by Arrow et al. (2008).\nThe World Bank attributed to each country all the cost of its CO2 emissions, i.e. the reference\nsituation is one where each country would have to pay for the worldwide consequences of its\nown emission. In the second case, Arrow et al. (2008) consider global CO2 emissions and\ncompute an ANS indicator by evaluating how much each country is going to be affected by\nthese common damages. As major polluters (such the USA) are not the ones who will suffer\nthe more from global warming, there are substantial (anti-)redistributive effects in Arrow’s\nestimates.\n\n284\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nAppendix 4:  More on the ANS and climate change\nThe mission for the group was to discuss sustainability. This question is linked to the\nproblems of intergenerational equity: if we are in a non-sustainable situation, then there is a\nstrong case in favor of some action in favor of future generations. However, the link is not\ncompletely univocal and this also deserves some clarifications. The issue of global warming\nis one good case study for such a clarification,\nThe point of departure is what can be called a “CO2 paradox”. On the one side, the Stern\nreview (2006) has strongly argued in favor of rapid action to avoid the long term negative\nconsequences of these CO2 emissions. On the other side, appendix 3 has shown  that, for\ndeveloped countries, it is hard to introduce CO2 emissions in aggregate net savings in a way\nthat clearly sends a message of unsustainability. This would require a very high valuation of\nthese CO2 emissions, much higher that the highest figures generally proposed in the literature\nand used in the Stern review. The result is all the more puzzling that both approaches use the\nsame conceptual apparatus, i.e. long term discounting of costs and benefits. What are the true\nlinks between the two approaches?\nLet’s first start by recalling how consequences of climatic change are generally evaluated.\nAs many other assesments of consequences of climate change, the Stern Review is based on\nan Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) of eco-environmental interactions. The model used is\nthe PAGE model (Hope, 2006). Another model frequently used in this literature is the DICE\nmodel (Nordhaus, 2007). These models allow economic evaluations of future damages to the\nenvironment. None of them question the fact that these consequences will be negative, but\nboth do so with a large degree of uncertainty, and this is in line with the message of the\npresent report concerning the difficulty to assess these costs with single headline numbers.\nThe PAGE model as used by Stern estimates damages in 2200 to lie in a bracket of -1 to -35%\nof Gross World Product (GWP) projected for that period. This bracket itself has been a matter\nof controversy, some commentators finding it too large, and some others too optimistic,\nputting a too low probability on the risk of major eco-environmental disruptions.\nNow, the problem faced by the Stern review has been to translate these figures in terms of\none single suggestive figure of how large is the problem. The point is that, even if these costs\nare large, they occur quite far away in the future, generally much later than 2050. In order to\ntranslate them in a number that can also make sense from the point of view of the present,\nthey are converted in terms of an equivalent permanent loss of well-being. This actuarial\nequivalent falls in a bracket of -5% to -20% of GWP, large figures indeed, based on a discount\nrate of 1.4%. \nWhat about policies that could help limit this loss? Knowing whether they are worth being\nimplemented is done through actuarial calculus. An abatment policy will generally have an\nimmediate cost, but provide returns in terms of a higher level of well-being tomorrow. We can\nevaluate whether the gains outweigh the costs by computing the difference between their\ndiscounted sums. This is still done over a time horizon that goes until 2200, and the choice of\nthe discount rate becomes here crucial. The low value chosen by Stern gives strong\njustifications to rapid action while other authors argue in favor of much more progressive\nabatment policies, based on much higher values of the discount rate. For instance, Nordhaus\nretains a value of 4.5%.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n285\nIt is on this point that has concentrated most of the debate upon the Stern report, with many\nauthors arguing that Stern’s assumption on discounting was unduly low, much lower than\ntypical values of market interest rates, therefore giving excessive weight to concern for the\nfuture. \nOther authors have however refined the analysis to point at additional reasons why the\nmessage of the Stern report had to be taken seriously. A review of all the arguments is\nprovided in Heal (2008). Among these arguments, we find the fact that market rates of interest\nare not a good normative guide for intergenerational comparisons, especially when we think\nthat markets do not work efficiently. There is also the idea that the problem is not that much\nthe consequences assessed in central scenarios, but the risk of very extreme ones -the\napplication of the precautionary principle-. There is also an idea suggested by Weitzman that\nthe true value of the discount rate may be itself uncertain and that, in the long run, precedence\nmust be given to the lowest of its plausible values. Another major point is that the analysis\nmust take into account the imperfect substitutability between produced goods and natural\ncapital, a feature that is ignored both by Stern and Nordhaus. As soon as this sustainability is\nimperfect, the divergent paths of production and environmental amenities lead to changes in\nrelative prices that have to be taken into account in the cost-benefit analysis of environmental\npolicies. Reference to a unique discount rate is no more valid, following an argument already\nprovided long ago by Malinvaud (1953). This point has been emphasized by Guesnerie\n(2004) and Sterner and Persson (2007). The latter have shown that a modified version of\nNordhaus’s DICE model incorporating such an heterogeneity can lead to conclusions that are\nstill more in favor of strong immediate action than the Stern review did. Further elaboration of\nthis line of argumentation will be found in Guéant, Guesnerie et Lasry (2009, under progress).\nAll this may suggest that the apparent opposition between messages sent by the ANS and\nmessages of cost-benefit analysis of immediate action only comes from different assumptions\non discount rates. But this is not that clear however. As was illustrated in the simulations of\nsection  3.3, the choice of the discount factor in the ANS or in an extended wealth framework\nhas no incidence on the message concerning sustainability. The reason is that non-\nsustainability is a characteristic of the time profile of current well-being, i.e. the fact that it\nwill decline someday below its current level: this characteristic is independent of the value of\nthe discount rate chosen for building the ANS. This discount rate will only have an influence\nupon how much in advance the decline in well-being will be anticipated by the indicator\n(Fleurbaey, 2009). \nThis has a clear consequence: if the policy recommendation of Stern-like assessments\ndepends on the discount factor, and if sustainability is a characteristic of the projected path of\nwell-being profile that does not depend on this discount factor, this means that there cannot be\nany one-to-one connection between messages derived from the two approaches. How is that\npossible? The explanation is that a difference must indeed be made between the observation\nthat a situation is not sustainable and the prescription of a policy change that can improve\nintergenerational welfare.\nLet’s present a few examples to show how these two notions differ. On all the following\ngraphs, we present two paths for prospective well-being. The one represented by the thick line\nis the spontaneous “business-as-usual” scenario in which no policy change occurs. The thin\nline corresponds to a “policy change” scenario, that systematically reduces well-being in the\nshort run, but helps improving it in the long run. We use labels BAU and PC to characterize\nthese two scenarios. \n\n286\nSUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT\nThe first figure on the left displays a configuration where messages concerning\nunsustainability and the opportunity of a policy changes will be consistent. The BAU path is a\nnon-monotonic one. Non-sustainability is a property of this BAU scenario that can be\ndetected sufficiently in advance with the ANS index if we fix the discount rate at a\nsufficiently low level. The PC scenario imposes small short run costs that allow restoring\nsustainability. The opportunity of moving from BAU to PC for a current planner will depend\non its choice of the discount rate but, for the profiles that are proposed, we can expect that this\nshift will be considered desirable even for relatively high values of this discount factor. In that\ncase, the message from the ANS index will appear consistent with the policy\nrecommandation. \nThe second figure more or less reflects the reference scenario of the Stern review. Even if\nit projected large negative impacts of climate change on global well-being, up to minus 35%\nof GWP in 2200, it applied them to a path of continuing economic growth at a rate making all\nfuture generations much more affluent than we are, despite climatic change. Such an\nassumption is of course debatable, and this brings us back to the debate upon long run\nuncertainty. For instance, it may well be that climatic disorders could lead to major conflicts\nor social disorders that would have a strong negative effect on our physical or human capital.\nOne can also consider that productivity extrapolations are based on biased estimates that\nignore that recent productivity gains have been precisely at the expense of environmental\nquality. But let’s assume here that this productivity assumption is correct. In this case, the\nBAU scenario passes the ANS sustainability test. But this does not mean that there is no\njustification for shifting from this BAU to the PC scenario. As in the previous scenario, the\nshort run cost is modest, and the long run advantages of a safer climate are considerable. In\nthat case, the PC scenario will appear desirable, at least to a planner who does not discount the\nfuture at an excessively high rate. In that case, the ANS index does not orient the policy\nmaker in the right direction.  \nThe last scenario is the exactly opposite -and unpleasant- one where sustainability is not\nwarranted, but without this being a sufficient motive for action. The BAU curve has the hump\nshape that it already had in the first scenario. Sustainability could be restored with a PC\nscenario, but at a very high cost for current generations, putting everybody close to starvation.\nFigure 3.7: Three different scenarios concerning sustainability and the opportunity of a policy \nchange\nBA\nt \nWell-being \nPC \nBA\nt \nWell-being \nPC\nBA\nt \nWell-being \nPC \n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n287\nIn that case, only a very high level of collective concern for these future generation would\nlead the planner to engage in this PC policy. \nThe central scenario shows that there is not necessarily a contradiction between computing\na positive rate of net adjusted savings -as the World Bank does for many countries- and being\nin favor of a strong immediate action in the domain of climatic change. We have seen indeed\nthat it is hard to arrive at negative values of this ANS, even with economic valuations of CO2\nemissions close to the order of magnitudes used in the Stern report. But this raises a strong\nproblem vis-à-vis policy makers. Can we let them with the only messages of an indicator that\ntells us that BAU is sustainable when we think that there are good reasons for action? \nOne answer to this dilemna could be to strengthen the sensitivity of the ANS index to\nenvironmental problems by focussing on dark scenarios, i.e. building a “precautionary” ANS\nwith imputed prices for natural resources computed to reflect these worst cases perspectives.  \nThe other possibility can be to treat climate change or other environmental changes as a\nfully separate matter. This can still be done in the extended wealth framework simply by\nreplacing the objective function with a function that exclusively depends upon the\nenvironmental good that we want to focus on, as was done in section 3.4. But this solution\nmay seem excessively formal. It can be more self-speaking to build ad hoc physical indicators\ncomparing stocks or emissions to predefined targets. Whatever we do, this does not mean that\nthe standard ANS becomes unuseful: it stills has its role of anticipating “global”\nunsustainability, but we are warned that it is not a sufficient guide for taking right decisions\non specific matters, this being true for environmental as well as for non-environmental issues.\n REFERENCES\nAbraham K. and C.
