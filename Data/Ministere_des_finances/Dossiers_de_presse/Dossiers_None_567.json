The\nCommission’s aim has been to identify the limits of GDP as an indicator of economic\nperformance and social progress, including the problems with its measurement; to\nconsider what additional information might be required for the production of more\nrelevant indicators of social progress; to assess the feasibility of alternative measurement\ntools, and to discuss how to present the statistical information in an appropriate way.\n2)\nIn effect, statistical indicators are important for designing and assessing policies aiming\nat advancing the progress of society, as well as for assessing and influencing the\nfunctioning of economic markets. Their role has increased significantly over the last two\ndecades. This reflects improvements in the level of education in the population, increases\nin the complexity of modern economies and the widespread use of information\ntechnology. In the “information society”, access to data, including statistical data, is\nmuch easier. More and more people look at statistics to be better informed or to make\ndecisions. To respond to the growing demand for information, the supply of statistics has\nalso increased considerably, covering new domains and phenomena.\n3)\nWhat we measure affects what we do; and if our measurements are flawed, decisions may\nbe distorted. Choices between promoting GDP and protecting the environment may be\nfalse choices, once environmental degradation is appropriately included in our\nmeasurement of economic performance. So too, we often draw inferences about what are\ngood policies by looking at what policies have promoted economic growth; but if our\nmetrics of performance are flawed, so too may be the inferences that we draw.  \n4)\nHowever, there often seems to be a marked distance between standard measures of\nimportant socio economic variables like economic growth, inflation, unemployment, etc.\nand widespread perceptions. The standard measures may suggest, for instance that there\nis less inflation or more growth than individuals perceive to be the case, and the gap is so\nlarge and so universal that it cannot be explained by reference to money illusion or to\nhuman psychology. In some countries, this gap has undermined confidence in official\nstatistics (for example, in France and in the United Kingdom. only one third of citizens\ntrust official figures, and these countries are not exceptions), with a clear impact on the\nway in which public discourse about the conditions of the economy and necessary\npolicies takes place.\n5)\nThere may be several explanations for the gap between the statistical measurement of\nsocio-economic phenomena and citizen perception of the same phenomena: \n\n8\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n– The statistical concepts may be correct, but the measurement process may be imperfect. \n– In many cases, there are debates about what are the right concepts, and the appropriate\nuse of different concepts.\n– When there are large changes in inequality (more generally a change in income distri-\nbution) gross domestic product (GDP) or any other aggregate computed per capita may\nnot provide an accurate assessment of the situation in which most people find themsel-\nves. If inequality increases enough relative to the increase in average per capital GDP,\nmost people can be worse off even though average income is increasing\n– The commonly used statistics may not be capturing some phenomena, which have an\nincreasing impact on the well-being of citizens. For example, traffic jams may increase\nGDP as a result of the increased use of gasoline, but obviously not the quality of life.\nMoreover, if citizens are concerned about the quality of air, and air pollution is\nincreasing, then statistical measures which ignore air pollution will provide an inaccurate\nestimate of what is happening to citizens’ well-being. Or a tendency to measure gradual\nchange may be inadequate to capture risks of abrupt alterations in the environment such\nas climate change. \n– The way in which statistical figures are reported or used may provide a distorted view\nof the trends of economic phenomena. For example, much emphasis is usually put on\nGDP although net national product (which takes into account the effect of depreciation),\nor real household income (which focuses on the real income of households within the\neconomy) may be more relevant. These numbers may differ markedly. Then, GDP is not\nwrong as such, but wrongly used.  What is needed is a better understanding of the appro-\npriate use of each measure.\n6)\nIndeed, for a long time there have been concerns about the adequacy of current measures\nof economic performance, in particular those solely based on GDP. Besides, there are\neven broader concerns about the relevance of these figures as measures of societal well-\nbeing. To focus specifically on the enhancement of inanimate objects of convenience (for\nexample in the GNP or GDP which have been the focus of a myriad of economic studies\nof progress), could be ultimately justified – to the extent it could be – only through what\nthese objects do to the human lives they can directly or indirectly influence. Moreover, it\nhas long been clear that GDP is an inadequate metric to gauge well-being over time\nparticularly in its economic, environmental, and social dimensions, some aspects of\nwhich are often referred to as sustainability. \nWhy is this report important?\n7)\nBetween the time that the Commission began working on this report and the completion\nof this Report, the economic context has radically changed. We are now living one of the\nworst financial, economic and social crises in post-war history. The reforms in\nmeasurement recommended by the Commission would be highly desirable, even if we\nhad not had the crisis. But some members of the Commission believe that the crisis\nprovides heightened urgency to these reforms. They believe that one of the reasons why\nthe crisis took many by surprise is that our measurement system failed us and/or market\nparticipants and government officials were not focusing on the right set of statistical\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n9\nindicators. In their view, neither the private nor the public accounting systems were able\nto deliver an early warning, and did not alert us that the seemingly bright growth\nperformance of the world economy between 2004 and 2007 may have been achieved at\nthe expense of future growth. It is also clear that some of the performance was a\n“mirage”, profits that were based on prices that had been inflated by a bubble. It is\nperhaps going too far to hope that had we had a better measurement system, one that\nwould have signalled problems ahead, so governments might have taken early measures\nto avoid or at least to mitigate the present turmoil. But perhaps had there been more\nawareness of the limitations of standard metrics, like GDP, there would have been less\neuphoria over economic performance in the years prior to the crisis; metrics which\nincorporated assessments of sustainability (e.g. increasing indebtedness) would have\nprovided a more cautious view of economic performance. But many countries lack a\ntimely and complete set of wealth accounts – the ‘balance sheets’ of the economy – that\ncould give a comprehensive picture of assets, debts and liabilities of the main actors in\nthe economy.\n8)\nWe are also facing a looming environmental crisis, especially associated with global\nwarming. Market prices are distorted by the fact that there is no charge imposed on\ncarbon emissions; and no account is made of the cost of these emissions in standard\nnational income accounts. Clearly, measures of economic performance that reflected\nthese environmental costs might look markedly different from standard measures.\n9)\nIf the view expressed in the preceding paragraphs is not necessarily shared by all\nmembers of the Commission, the whole Commission is convinced that the crisis is\nteaching us a very important lesson: those attempting to guide the economy and our\nsocieties are like pilots trying to steering a course without a reliable compass. The\ndecisions they (and we as individual citizens) make depend on what we measure, how\ngood our measurements are and how well our measures are understood. We are almost\nblind when the metrics on which action is based are ill-designed or when they are not\nwell understood. For many purposes, we need better metrics. Fortunately, research in\nrecent years has enabled us to improve our metrics, and it is time to incorporate in our\nmeasurement systems some of these advances. There is also consensus among the\nCommission members that better measures may enable us to steer our economies better\nthrough and out of crises. Many of the indicators put forward by the report will lend\nthemselves to this purpose.\n10) The report is about measurement rather than policies, thus it does not discuss how best\nour societies could advance through collective actions in the pursuit of various goals.\nHowever, as what we measure shapes what we collectively strive to pursue – and what\nwe pursue determines what we measure - the report and its implementation may have a\nsignificant impact on the way in which our societies looks at themselves and, therefore,\non the way in which policies are designed, implemented and assessed.\n11) The Commission notes the important progress in statistical measurement that has\noccurred in recent years, and urges continued efforts to improve our statistical data base\nand the indicators that are constructed from this data base. The report indicates avenues\nfor more or different measurement efforts in various domains, and we hope that it will\ninfluence future statistical policies in both developed and developing countries, as well as\nthe work of international organisations that play a key role in the development of\nstatistical standards worldwide.  \n\n10\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBy whom has the report been written?\n12) This is a report written by economists and social scientists. The members of the\nCommission represent a broad range of specialisations, from national accounting to the\neconomics of climate change. The members have conducted research on social capital,\nhappiness, and health and mental well-being. They share the belief that it is important to\nbuild bridges between different communities – between the producers and users of\nstatistical information, whatever their discipline – that have become increasingly distant\nin recent years. Commission members see their expertise as a complement to reports on\nsimilar topics that were written from a different perspective, for instance by scientists on\nclimate change or by psychologists on mental health. Although the core of the report is\nrather technical, the summaries of the technical chapter have been written using, as much\nas possible, non-technical language.\nTo whom is the report addressed?\n13) The Commission hopes that the Report will find a receptive audience among four distinct\ngroups, and it has been written with that in mind. The Report is addressed, first of all, to\npolitical leaders. In this time of crises, when new political narratives are necessary to\nidentify where our societies should go, the report advocates a shift of emphasis from a\n“production-oriented” measurement system to one focused on the well-being of current\nand future generations, i.e. toward broader measures of social progress.  \n14) Second, the report is aimed at reaching policy-makers who wish to get a better sense of\nwhich indicators are available and useful to design, implement and assess policies aimed\nat improving well-being and foster social progress. Policy-makers are reminded both of\nthe richness and of the shortcomings of existing data but also of the fact that reliable\nquantitative information ‘does not grow on trees’ and significant investments need to be\nmade to develop statistics and indicators that provide policymakers with the information\nthey need to make the decisions confronting them. \n15) Third, the report has been written for the academic community, statisticians, and\nintensive users of statistics. They are reminded of how difficult it can be to produce\nreliable data and of the numerous assumptions that underlay all statistical series.\nAcademics will, hopefully, become more cautious in the confidence they place in certain\nstatistics. Those in national statistical offices will, hopefully find helpful suggestions\nabout areas where further developments might be particularly valuable. \n16) Lastly, the report has been written for civil society organisations that are both users and\nproducers of statistics. More generally, it is addressed to the public at large, whether from\nricher or poorer countries and whether rich or poor within societies. We hope that through\na better understanding of the statistical data and indicators that are available (their\nstrengths and limits), they can make a better assessment of the problems facing their\nsocieties. We hope the report will also serve journalists and the media who have a\nresponsibility in enabling citizens to get a sense of what is happening in the society in\nwhich they are living. Information is a public good; the more we are informed about what\nis happening in our society, the better will our democracies be able to function.\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n11\n What are the main messages and recommendations?\n17) The report distinguishes between an assessment of current well-being and an assessment\nof sustainability, whether this can last over time. Current well-being has to do with both\neconomic resources, such as income, and with non-economic aspects of peoples’ life\n(what they do and what they can do, how they feel, and the natural environment they live\nin). Whether these levels of well-being can be sustained over time depends on whether\nstocks of capital that matter for our lives (natural, physical, human, social) are passed on\nto future generations. \nTo organise its work, the Commission organized itself into three working groups,\nfocusing respectively on: Classical GDP issues, Quality of life and Sustainability. The\nfollowing main messages and recommendations arise from the report\nTowards better measures of economic performance in a complex economy\n18) Before going beyond GDP and tackling the more difficult task of measuring well-being,\nit is worth asking where existing measures of economic performance need improving.\nMeasuring production – a variable which among other things determines the level of\nemployment – is essential for the monitoring of economic activity. The first main\nmessage of our report is that time has come to adapt our system of measurement of\neconomic activity to better reflect the structural changes which have characterized the\nevolution of modern economies. In effect, the growing share of services and the\nproduction of increasingly complex products make the measurement of output and\neconomic performance more difficult than in the past. There are now many products\nwhose quality is complex, multi-dimensional and subject to rapid change. This is obvious\nfor goods, like cars, computers, washing machines and the like, but is even truer for\nservices, such as medical services, educational services, information and communication\ntechnologies, research activities and financial services. In some countries and some\nsectors, increasing “output” is more a matter of an increase in the quality of goods\nproduced and consumed than in the quantity. Capturing quality change is a tremendous\nchallenge, yet this is vital to measuring real income and real consumption, some of the\nkey determinants of people’s material well-being. Under-estimating quality\nimprovements is equivalent to over-estimating the rate of inflation, and therefore to\nunder-estimating real income. The opposite is true when quality improvements are over-\nstated. \n19) Governments play an important part in today’s economies. They provide services of a\n“collective” nature, such as security, and of a more “individual” nature, such as medical\nservices and education. The mix between private and public provision of individual\nservices varies significantly across countries and over time. Beyond the contribution of\ncollective services to citizens’ living standards, individual services, particularly\neducation, medical services, public housing or public sports facilities, are almost\ncertainly valued positively by citizens. These services tend to be large in scale, and have\nincreased considerably since World War II, but, in many cases, they remain badly\nmeasured. Traditionally, measures have been based on the inputs used to produce these\nservices (such as the number of doctors) rather than on the actual outputs produced (such\nas the number of particular medical treatments). Making adjustments for quality changes\nis even more difficult. Because outputs are taken to move in tandem with inputs\n\n12\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nproductivity change in the provision of these services is ignored. It follows that if there is\npositive (negative) productivity change in the public sector, our measures under (over)-\nestimate economic growth and real income. For a satisfactory measure of economic\nperformance and living standards it is thus important to come to grips with measuring\ngovernment output. (In our present, admittedly flawed, system of measurement based on\nexpenditures, government output represents around 20% of GDP in many OECD\ncountries and total government expenditure more than 40% for the OECD countries.) \n20) While there are methodological disagreements about how to make the adjustments to\nquality or how to go about measuring government output, there is a broad consensus that\nadjustments should be made, and even about the principles which should guide such\nadjustments. The disagreements arise in the practical implementation of these principles.\nThe Commission has addressed both the principles and the difficulties in\nimplementations, in its Report.\nFrom production to well-being\n21) Another key message, and unifying theme of the report, is that the time is ripe for our\nmeasurement system to shift emphasis from measuring economic production to\nmeasuring people’s well-being. And measures of well-being should be put in a context of\nsustainability. Despite deficiencies in our measures of production, we know much more\nabout them than about well-being. Changing emphasis does not mean dismissing GDP\nand production measures. They emerged from concerns about market production and\nemployment; they continue to provide answers to many important questions such as\nmonitoring economic activity. But emphasising well-being is important because there\nappears to be an increasing gap between the information contained in aggregate GDP\ndata and what counts for common people’s well-being. This means working towards the\ndevelopment of a statistical system that complements measures of market activity by\nmeasures centred on people’s well-being and by measures that capture sustainability.\nSuch a system must, of necessity, be plural – because no single measure can summarize\nsomething as complex as the well-being of the members of society, our system of\nmeasurement must encompass a range of different measures. The issue of aggregation\nacross dimensions (that is to say, how we add up, for example, a measure of health with a\nmeasure of consumption of conventional goods), while important, is subordinate to the\nestablishment of  a broad statistical system that captures as many of the relevant\ndimensions as possible. Such a system should not just measure average levels of well-\nbeing within a given community, and how they change over time, but also document the\ndiversity of peoples’ experiences and the linkages across various dimensions of people’s\nlife. There are several dimensions to well-being but a good place to start is the\nmeasurement of material well-being or living standards.\nRecommendation 1: When evaluating material well-being, look at income and consumption \nrather than production\n22) GDP is the most widely-used measure of economic activity. There are international\nstandards for its calculation, and much thought has gone into its statistical and conceptual\nbases. Earlier paragraphs have emphasized some of the important areas where more\nprogress is needed in its computation. As statisticians and economists know very well,\nGDP mainly measures market production – expressed in money units – and as such it is\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n13\nuseful. However, it has often been treated as if it were a measure of economic well-being.\nConflating the two can lead to misleading indications about how well-off people are and\nentail the wrong policy decisions. Material living standards are more closely associated\nwith measures of net national income, real household income and consumption –\nproduction can expand while income decreases or vice versa when account is taken of\ndepreciation, income flows into and out of a country, and differences between the prices\nof output and the prices of consumer products.\nRecommendation 2: Emphasise the household perspective\n23) While it is informative to track the performance of economies as a whole, trends in\ncitizens’ material living standards are better followed through measures of household\nincome and consumption. Indeed, the available national accounts data shows that in a\nnumber of OECD countries real household income has grown quite differently from real\nGDP per capita, and typically at a lower rate. The household perspective entails taking\naccount of payments between sectors, such as taxes going to government, social benefits\ncoming from government, and interest payments on household loans going to financial\ncorporations. Properly defined, household income and consumption should also reflect\nin-kind services provided by government, such as subsidized health care and educational\nservices. A major effort of statistical reconciliation will also be required to understand\nwhy certain measures such as household income can move differently depending on the\nunderlying statistical source.\nRecommendation 3: Consider income and consumption jointly with wealth\n24) Income and consumption are crucial for assessing living standards, but in the end they\ncan only be gauged in conjunction with information on wealth. A household that spends\nits wealth on consumption goods increases its current well-being but at the expense of its\nfuture well-being. The consequences of such behavior would be captured in a\nhousehold’s balance sheet, and the same holds for other sectors of the economy, and for\nthe economy as a whole. To construct balance sheets, we need comprehensive accounts\nof assets and liabilities. Balance sheets for countries are not novel in concept, but their\navailability is still limited and their construction should be promoted. Measures of wealth\nare central to measuring sustainability. What is carried over into the future necessarily\nhas to be expressed as stocks – of physical, natural, human and social capital. The right\nvaluation of these stocks plays a crucial role, and is often problematic. There is also a\nneed to “stress test” balance sheets with alternative valuations when market prices for\nassets are not available or are subject to bubbles and bursts.  Some more direct non-\nmonetary indicators may be preferable when the monetary valuation is very uncertain or\ndifficult to derive.\nRecommendation 4: Give more prominence to the distribution of income, consumption \nand wealth\n25) Average income, consumption and wealth are meaningful statistics, but they do not tell\nthe whole story about living standards. For example, a rise in average income could be\nunequally shared across groups, leaving some households relatively worse-off than\nothers. Thus, average measures of income, consumption and wealth should be\naccompanied by indicators that reflect their distribution. Median consumption (income,\n\n14\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nwealth) provides a better measure of what is happening to the “typical” individual or\nhousehold than average consumption (income or wealth). But for many purposes, it is\nalso important to know what is happening at the bottom of the income/wealth distribution\n(captured in poverty statistics), or at the top. Ideally, such information should not come in\nisolation but be linked, i.e. one would like information about how well-off households are\nwith regard to different dimensions of material living standards: income, consumption\nand wealth. After all, a low-income household with above-average wealth is not\nnecessarily worse-off than a medium-income household with no wealth. (The desirability\nof providing information on the “joint distribution” of the dimensions of people’s well-\nbeing will be raised once again in the recommendations below on how to measure quality\nof life.)\nRecommendation 5: Broaden income measures to non-market activities\n26) There have been major changes in how households and society function. For example,\nmany of the services people received from other family members in the past are now\npurchased on the market. This shift translates into a rise in income as measured in the\nnational accounts and may give a false impression of a change in living standards, while\nit merely reflects a shift from non-market to market provision of services. Many services\nthat households produce for themselves are not recognized in official income and\nproduction measures, yet they constitute an important aspect of economic activity. While\ntheir exclusion from official measures reflects uncertainty about data more than\nconceptual difficulties, there has been progress in this arena; still, more and more\nsystematic work in this area should be undertaken. This should start with information on\nhow people spend their time that is comparable both over the years and across countries.\nComprehensive and periodic accounts of household activity as satellites to the core\nnational accounts should complement the picture. In developing countries, the production\nof goods (for instance food or shelter) by households plays an important role. Tracking\nthe production of such home-produced goods is important to assess consumption levels\nof households in these countries. \n27) Once one starts focusing on non-market activities, the question of leisure arises.\nConsuming the same bundle of goods and services but working for 1500 hours a year\ninstead of 2000 hours a year implies an increase in one’s standard of living. Although\nvaluation of leisure is fraught with difficulties, comparisons of living standards over time\nor across countries needs to take into account the amount of leisure that people enjoy.\nWell-being is multi-dimensional\n28) To define what well-being means a multidimensional definition has to be used. Based on\nacademic research and a number of concrete initiatives developed around the world, the\nCommission has identified the following key dimension that should be taken into\naccount. At least in principle, these dimensions should be considered simultaneously:\ni.\nMaterial living standards (income, consumption and wealth);\nii.\nHealth;\niii.\nEducation;\niv.\nPersonal activities including work\nv.\nPolitical voice and governance;\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n15\nvi.\nSocial connections and relationships;\nvii. Environment (present and future conditions);\nviii. Insecurity, of an economic as well as a physical nature.\nAll these dimensions shape people’s well-being, and yet many of them are missed by conven-\ntional income measures.\nObjective and subjective dimensions of well-being are both important\nRecommendation 6: Quality of life depends on people’s objective conditions and capabilities.\nSteps should be taken to improve measures of people’s health, education, personal activities\nand environmental conditions. In particular, substantial effort should be devoted to\ndeveloping and implementing robust, reliable measures of social connections, political voice,\nand insecurity that can be shown to predict life satisfaction.\n29) The information relevant to valuing quality of life goes beyond people’s self-reports and\nperceptions to include measures of their “functionings” and freedoms. In effect, what\nreally matters are the capabilities of people, that is, the extent of their opportunity set and\nof their freedom to choose among this set, the life they value. The choice of relevant\nfunctionings and capabilities for any quality of life measure is a value judgment, rather\nthan a technical exercise. But while the precise list of the features affecting quality of life\ninevitably rests on value judgments, there is a consensus that quality of life depends on\npeople’s health and education, their everyday activities (which include the right to a\ndecent job and housing), their participation in the political process, the social and natural\nenvironment in which they live, and the factors shaping their personal and economic\nsecurity. Measuring all these features requires both objective and subjective data. The\nchallenge in all these fields is to improve upon what has already been achieved, to\nidentify gaps in available information, and to invest in statistical capacity in areas (such\nas time-use) where available indicators remain deficient.\nRecommendation 7: Quality-of-life indicators in all the dimensions covered should assess \ninequalities in a comprehensive way\n30) Inequalities in human conditions are integral to any assessment of quality of life across\ncountries and the way that it is developing over time. Most dimensions of quality-of-life\nrequire appropriate separate measures of inequality, but, as noted in par. 25, taking into\naccount linkages and correlations. Inequalities in quality of life should be assessed across\npeople, socio-economic groups, gender and generations, with special attention to\ninequalities that have arisen more recently, such as those linked to immigration.\nRecommendation 8: Surveys should be designed to assess the links between various quality-\nof-life domains for each person, and this information should be used when designing policies \nin various fields\n31) It is critical to address questions about how developments in one domain of quality of life\naffect other domains, and how developments in all the various fields are related to\nincome. This is important because the consequences for quality of life of having multiple\ndisadvantages far exceed the sum of their individual effects. Developing measures of\n\n16\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nthese cumulative effects requires information on the “joint distribution” of the most\nsalient features of quality of life across everyone in a country through dedicated surveys.\nSteps in this direction could also be taken by including in all surveys some standard\nquestions that allow classifying respondents based on a limited set of characteristics.\nWhen designing policies in specific fields, impacts on indicators pertaining to different\nquality-of-life dimensions should be considered jointly, to address the interactions\nbetween dimensions and the needs of people who are disadvantaged in several domains\nRecommendation 9: Statistical offices should provide the information needed to aggregate \nacross quality-of-life dimensions, allowing the construction of different indexes.\n32) While assessing quality-of-life requires a plurality of indicators, there are strong\ndemands to develop a single summary measure. Several summary measures of quality of\nlife are possible, depending on the question addressed and the approach taken. Some of\nthese measures are already being used, such as average levels of life-satisfaction for a\ncountry as a whole, or composite indices that aggregate averages across objective\ndomains, such as the Human Development Index. Others could be implemented if\nnational statistical systems made the necessary investment to provide the data required\nfor their computation. These include measures of the proportion of one’s time in which\nthe strongest reported feeling is a negative one, measures based on counting the\noccurrence and severity of various objective features of people’s lives, and (equivalent-\nincome) measures based on people’s states and preferences.\n33) The Commission believes that in addition to objective indicators of well-being,\nsubjective measures of the quality-of-life should be considered. \nRecommendation 10: Measures of both objective and subjective well-being provide key\ninformation about people’s quality of life. Statistical offices should incorporate questions to\ncapture people’s life evaluations, hedonic experiences and priorities in their own survey.\n34) Research has shown that it is possible to collect meaningful and reliable data on\nsubjective as well as objective well-being. Subjective well-being encompasses different\naspects (cognitive evaluations of one’s life, happiness, satisfaction, positive emotions\nsuch as joy and pride, and negative emotions such as pain and worry): each of them\nshould be measured separately to derive a more comprehensive appreciation of people’s\nlives. Quantitative measures of these subjective aspects hold the promise of delivering\nnot just a good measure of quality of life per se, but also a better understanding of its\ndeterminants, reaching beyond people’s income and material conditions. Despite the\npersistence of many unresolved issues, these subjective measures provide important\ninformation about quality of life. Because of this, the types of question that have proved\ntheir value within small-scale and unofficial surveys should be included in larger-scale\nsurveys undertaken by official statistical offices. \nUse a pragmatic approach towards measuring sustainability \n35) Measuring and assessing sustainability has been a central concern of the Commission.\nSustainability poses the challenge of determining if at least the current level of well-\nbeing can be maintained for future generations. By its very nature, sustainability involves\nthe future and its assessment involves many assumptions and normative choices. This is\n\nReport by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress\n17\nfurther complicated by the fact that at least some aspects of environmental sustainability\n(notably climate change) is affected by interactions between the socio-economic and\nenvironmental models followed by different countries. The issue is indeed complex,\nmore complex than the already complicated issue of measuring current well-being or\nperformance. \nRecommendation 11: Sustainability assessment requires a well-identified dashboard of\nindicators. The distinctive feature of the components of this dashboard should be that they are\ninterpretable as variations of some underlying “stocks”. A monetary index of sustainability\nhas its place in such a dashboard but, under the current state of the art, it should remain\nessentially focused on economic aspects of sustainability.\n36) The assessment of sustainability is complementary to the question of current well-being\nor economic performance, and must be examined separately. This may sound trivial and\nyet it deserves emphasis, because some existing approaches fail to adopt this principle,\nleading to potentially confusing messages. For instance, confusion may arise when one\ntries to combine current well-being and sustainability into a single indicator. To take an\nanalogy, when driving a car, a meter that added up in one single number the current speed\nof the vehicle and the remaining level of gasoline would not be of any help to the driver.\nBoth pieces of information are critical and need to be displayed in distinct, clearly visible\nareas of the dashboard. \n37) At a minimum, in order to measure sustainability, what we need are indicators that\ninform us about the change in the quantities of the different factors that matter for future\nwell-being. Put differently, sustainability requires the simultaneous preservation or\nincrease in several “stocks”: quantities and qualities of natural resources, and of human,\nsocial and physical capital. \n38) There are two versions to the stock approach to sustainability. One version just looks at\nvariations in each stock separately, assessing whether the stock is increase or decreasing,\nwith a view particularly to doing whatever is necessary to keep each above some critical\nthreshold.  The second version converts all these assets into a monetary equivalent,\nthereby implicitly assuming substitutability between different types of capital, so that a\ndecrease in, say, natural capital might be offset by a sufficient increase in physical capital\n(appropriately weighted). Such an approach has significant potential, but also several\nlimitations, the most important being the absence of many markets on which valuation of\nassets could be based. Even when there are market values, there is no guarantee that they\nadequately reflect how the different assets matter for future well-being. The monetary\napproach requires imputations and modelling which raise informational difficulties. All\nthis suggests starting with a more modest approach, i.e. focusing the monetary\naggregation on items for which reasonable valuation techniques exist, such as physical\ncapital, human capital and certain natural resources. In so doing, it should be possible to\nassess the “economic” component of sustainability, that is, whether or not countries are\nover-consuming their economic wealth. \nPhysical indicators for environmental pressures \nRecommendation 12: The environmental aspects of sustainability deserve a separate follow-\nup based on a well-chosen set of physical indicators. In particular there is a need for a clear\n\n18\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nindicator of our proximity to dangerous levels of environmental damage (such as associated\nwith climate change or the depletion of fishing stocks.)\n39) For the reasons mentioned above, placing a monetary value on the natural environment is\noften difficult and separate sets of physical indicators will be needed to monitor the state\nof the environment. This is in particular the case when it comes to irreversible and/or\ndiscontinuous alterations to the environment. For that reason members of the\nCommission believe in particular that there is a need for a clear indicator of increases in\natmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases associated with proximity to dangerous\nlevels of climate change (or levels of emissions that might reasonably be expected to lead\nto such concentrations in the future. Climate change (due to increases in atmospheric\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases) is also special in that it constitutes a truly global\nissue that cannot be measured with regard to national boundaries. Physical indicators of\nthis kind can only be identified with the help of the scientific community. Fortunately, a\ngood deal of work has already been undertaken in this field. \nWhat is next?\n40) The Commission regards its report as opening a discussion rather than closing it. The\nreport hints at issues that ought to be addressed in the context of more comprehensive\nresearch efforts. Other bodies, at the national and international level, should discuss the\nrecommendations in this report, identify their limits, and see how best they can contribute\nto this broad agenda, each from its own perspective.\n41) The Commission believes that a global debate around the issues and recommendations\nraised in this report provides an important venue for a discussion of societal values, for\nwhat we, as a society, care about, and whether we are really striving for what is important\n42) At the national level, round-tables should be established, with the involvement of\nstakeholders, to identify and prioritise those indicators that carry to potential for a shared\nview of how social progress is happening and how it can be sustained over time. \n43) The Commission hopes that this Report will provide the impetus not only for this broader\ndiscussion, but for on-going research into the development of better metrics that will\nenable us to assess better economic performance and social progress.\n", "published_date": null, "section": "Dossiers"}
