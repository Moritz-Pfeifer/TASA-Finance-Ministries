On the contrary, it is forward-looking, \nan innovator with remarkable talents built \nupon a tradition of industrial and artisanal \nknow-how. In other words, innovation is \npart and parcel of our tradition. It is in \nFrance’s DNA.\nFrance may be home to the Louvre \nmuseum, Dom Pérignon, and Foucault’s \npendulum—but it is also where you will \nﬁ nd Airbus, Air Liquide, Thalès, Renault, \nPSA, Alstom, Michelin, or newcomers like \nParrot and Sigfox, and numerous small and \nintermediate sized companies that easily \nhold their own in international markets. \nOur economic competitiveness comes from \na range of assets. We have top-notch \ntraining, boundless creativity, impressive \nproductivity, low cost and highly reliable \nenergy supply, and ﬁ rst-rate infrastructure, \nincluding the most modern highway and rail \nsystems in Europe. France beneﬁ ts from a \nprime location on the European continent, \nthe biggest market in the world today.\nFrance’s industrial excellence also lies on \nfour distinct pillars. For centuries we have \nproduced outstanding mathematicians, and \nour education system continually turns out \nmore. We count more than a million engineers \nand some of the world’s best engineering \nprogrammes. Our industrial designers know \nhow to combine pragmatism with style. And \nFrance’s entrepreneurs are as plentiful as \nthey are ambitious.\nInvestors are taking note. For nearly a decade, \nFrance has been the top European country \nfor foreign investments in the industrial sector. \nWe are using every means at our disposal to \nattract even more investment, to guarantee \nthat companies enjoy the best conditions to \ngrow, develop, and conquer new markets. \nFor example, we have simpliﬁ ed bureaucratic \nprocedures; it is now so quick and easy to \ncreate a business in France. We have \nstreamlined labor related procedures. \nReduced taxes and social charges are \nanother enticement for foreign companies \nand their employees as well as a one-shot \nﬁ scal incentive for productive investment.  \nAnd France is now recognized worldwide for \nthe competitiveness of its R&D thanks to a \nunique tax credit, on top of the quality of our \nresearchers and engineers.\nFrance is innovative, entrepreneurial, creative \n—and determined to be among the leading \ncountries for industry. We are proud of our \nunique model, aligning social cohesion with \neconomic vitality for strong and sustainable \ngrowth. But we are also open to the world. \nI thank all the French companies, large and \nsmall, who have come to participate in the \nHanover trade fair, promoting the appeal of \nour country’s industry and helping it to \nshine beyond our borders. And I say to all \nother companies, you’re welcome in France!\nEmmanuel Macron, \nMinister of Economy, Industry \nand Digital Af airs\n\nCréative Industry Press Kit\nApril 2016\n2\nCREATIVE INDUSTRY\nPROMOTING THE NATION’S INDUSTRIAL \nKNOW-HOW AND INGENUITY\nFrom motion picture cameras to high-\nspeed trains to robotic surgical assistants, \nFrance’s contributions to industry have \nalways combined intelligence, \ndetermination, daring, and creativity.\nFrance now presents “Créative Industry,” \nan initiative promoting the nation’s \nindustrial know-how and ingenuity.\nCréative Industry is part of “Créative \nFrance,” a label proclaiming the renewed \ndynamism of this country’s innovation \nand economic activity in sectors as \nvaried as industry, technology, culture, \ngastronomy, science, and healthcare. \nFrance’s progress in all of these ﬁ elds \nreveals not only a common ambition \nbut an ability to capitalise on the \ncreative potential and entrepreneurial \nspirit of its people. Creative Industry \napplies this general movement to a \nspeciﬁ c theme, and comes at a turning \npoint in the technological and digital \ntransformation of French industry.\nThe very symbol of France is a symbol \nof industry: the Eif el Tower, built in 1889 \nfor the World Exposition, at a time when the \ncountry was bubbling over with innovation, \nproducing the Paris métro, the motion \npicture camera, Foucault’s pendulum, \ninﬂ atable car tyres, and much more.\nToday’s digital revolution is as disruptive \nas the industrial one a century ago. Now \nas then, France claims its place as \na creative trailblazer. Its government and \npeople have rediscovered a passion for \nindustry. The young generation is equally \nenthusiastic: a recent Opinion Way / Ecole \nnationale supérieure d'arts et métiers \nsurvey shows that 76% of French high \nschools students in science and \ntechnology have a positive opinion of \nindustry. However, only 40% imagine \nactually working in the industrial sector.\nThis paradox underlines the importance of \ntransforming industry in order to propose \nthe new generation a digital-friendly, \nattractive professionnal playground\nAnd yet, industry is a motor of the French \neconomy, bringing in €263 billion — 13.8% \nof France’s GDP—in 2015. Industrial \nproducts represent more than 2/3 of \nFrance’s worldwide exports, or €420 billion \nin value, with the agroalimentary sector \nin the lead. \nForeign companies working in France \nhave come to realise what the vitality of \nFrance’s economy and industry can of er \nthem. For each of the past several years, \nFrance has been a favourite destination \nfor foreign direct investments (FDI). Nearly \none employee in eight works in a subsidiary \nof a foreign company. In industrial \nmanufacturing, that ratio rises to one \nin ﬁ ve—more than in Germany, Italy, or \nFinland. The Swiss agroalimentary giant \nNestlé counts more than 19,000 employees \nin France, while Barilla opened its biggest \nproduction site—4,300 square metres—\nin Châteauroux. The Japanese automaker \nToyota chose the north of France as \nits European base. And the American \ncompany Hexcel has reinforced its \npresence in France with a new factory \nfor polyacrylonitrile in Roussillon.\nFrance’s long-term strategy has allowed \nit to build innovation clusters that are \ncapable of competing internationally. \nExports are concentrated in strong value-\nadded sectors. The dynamism of the \ntransport materials sector (a 10.5% rise \n\nCréative Industry Press Kit\nApril 2016\n3\nin exports), led by aeronautics and \nautomobiles, made up more than half the \ngrowth of the French export market in 2015.\nAirbus, a European project with new \nheadquarters in Toulouse, is another good \nexample. France is home to large factories \nfor Airbus, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus \nDefense and Space, and the group’s staf  \nin France has increased 31% since its \ncreation. Each year, Airbus Group exports \nmore than 20 billion euros worth of \naeronautical and aerospace products. \nThe technological and commercial success \nof Airbus aircraft assembled in Toulouse \ndemonstrates how France, hand in hand \nwith Europe, can invest in complex, long-\nterm industrial projects.\nThe agroalimentary industry is the French \neconomy’s number one sector, known \nthroughout the world thanks to groups \nsuch as Danone, leader in dairy products. \nThe automobile industry, one of the most \ncompetitive sectors in the world, also \nexempliﬁ es France’s capacity to excel \nthrough innovation; France’s automobile \nindustry invests more than 5.9 billion euros \nin R&D and is the industry that ﬁ les the \nmost patents, ahead of the pharmaceutical \nindustry. More than three-quarters of \nFrench automakers’ production is sold \noutside the country.\nAlongside these big groups, a dense \nnetwork of small and mid-sized companies \nhas taken of . Taking advantage of France’s \nindustrial dynamism, entrepreneurs from \naround the world have chosen this country \nas a place for growth, appreciating its \nproximity to the immense European \nmarket and the strength of its large \nindustrial groups. Such assets, notably \nFrance’s location at the heart of the \nEuropean Union, give a boost to foreign \ninvestors hoping to develop internationally. \nOne example is the Japanese company \nMBK’s factory in Saint Quentin ; practically \n90% of its 150-million-euro turnover comes \nfrom exports. Chemchina, a Chinese \nchemical leader, has multiplied its \ninvestments in France via its subsidiary \nAdisseo, specialising in animal feed \nadditives. More than 90% of its sales come \nfrom exports, too.\nThe Japanese automaker Toyota, in France \nsince 1977, chose the north of the country \nas its European base. The British group \nKingﬁ sher has more than 15,000 workers \nin France and continues to grow. Siemens, \npresent in France for more than 160 years, \ncounts more than eight industrial sites, \n11 R&D centers, and more than \n6,900 employees ; in 2015 the German \ncompany decided to make Toulouse the \nworld headquarters for its « Val » driverless \nlight metro systems. \nForeign investors recognise France’s skill \nat making equipment, transportation, \nmetals, and chemicals, along with new \ntechnologies such as 3D design, virtual \nprototyping, robotics, and composite \nmaterials. These are technologies that \nrequire digital transformation—and here, \ntoo, France boasts world leaders such as \nDassault Systèmes and Atos. Cutting-edge \ncompanies and startups are sprouting up \nall over the country and competing on \nthe international marketplace. \nOne reason for France’s success is that its \ncompanies invest massively in industrial \ninnovation. In 2012, they spent 78% of total \nR&D, or nearly €24 billion, on industry. \nIn 2014, France held sixth place worldwide \nfor the number of patents ﬁ led, ahead \nof the United Kingdom.\nAnother factor is that French industry \nboasts a highly talented pool of over \nthree million employees—engineers, \nmathematicians, designers, researchers, \nscientists, and specialists, trained in the \ncountry’s top-notch schools. It is estimated \nthat every industrial job generates three \nor four more jobs in other sectors, having \na positive ef ect on the overall economy.\nCréative Industry celebrates an exciting \ntime for France, as the country builds \nupon its reputation as inventors and \nentrepreneurs, puts to use its remarkable \nskills and strengths, embraces the digital \nage, and prepares to re-emerge \nas a global industrial powerhouse.\n\nCréative Industry Press Kit\nApril 2016\n4\nA KEY SECTOR IN FRANCE\nA POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY\nA KEY SECTOR FOR INNOVATION\nThe French industrial \nsector represents \n€263 billion of GDP\n78% of total R&D, or €23.4 billion, is spent on industry\n13.8% of France’s GDP\n3.1 million employees work\nin the industrial sector\nEvery industrial \njob generates \nthree or four \nmore jobs\nin other sectors\n2/3 of France’s exports, \nworth €420 billion, \nare industrial products\nless GHG between \n1990 and 2012\n40% \n\nCréative Industry Press Kit\nApril 2016\n5\nTOP 10 2015 EXPORTERS FROM FRANCE\n50% OF THE TOP TEN OF FOREIGN \nINVESTORS ARE INDUSTRIALS\nIN 2015\nTOP 5 FOREIGN EXPORTERS FROM \nTHE IMPORT/EXPORT STANDINGS \nTHAT ALSO INVEST IN FRANCE\nAirbus SAS / Airbus Operation –\nAeronautical and Aerospace\nConstruction\nRenault SAS –\nAutomobile Manufacturing\nPeugeot Citroën Automobile SA –\nAutomobile Manufacturing\nSnecma -\nAeronautical and Aerospace\nConstruction\nSanoﬁ  Winthrop Industrie – \nPharmaceutical Industry\nArcelorMittal Atlantique\net Lorraine -\nSteel Manufacturing\nTotal Raf  nage France – \nPetroleum Reﬁ nery\nSchneider Electric Industries SAS –\nElectricity Distribution \nand Management\nDassault Aviation -\nAeronautical and Aerospace\nConstruction\nLilly France -\nPharmaceutical Industry\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nVolkswagen AG\nArcelormittal\nGeneral Electric \nCompany\nRobert Bosch Gmbh\nTata Group\nKlesch & Company\nAirbus Group\nArcelormittal\nAb Volvo\nAlenia Aeronautica\n\nCréative Industry Press Kit\nApril 2016\n6\n4 UNIQUE TRAITS FRANCE BRINGS \nTO THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR\nUnique qualities France brings \nto industry \nCreative thinkers, a highly-trained workforce, \ncapable managers, ambitious entrepreneurs: \nthese are the assets driving France’s \nindustrial success. An entrepreneurial spirit \nis sweeping the land, while an outstanding \neducation system turns out some of the \nworld’s best mathematicians, engineers, \nand designers. They are the key to France’s \nexcellence in sectors from aeronautics to \nhealthcare, its original approach, its ability \nto disrupt, its healthy export market, its \noverseas appeal, and its position—always \none step ahead.\nIt is no accident that France is the ﬁ rst \nEuropean country in Thomson Reuters’ \nTop 100 Global Innovators for 2015, ahead \nof Germany. What’s more, 2014 marked \nthe fourth year in a row that France was \nnumber one in the Deloitte Technology \nFast 500 EMEA.\nMathematics & scientiﬁ c Research, \na French tradition of excellence\nMathematics has an extraordinary intellectual \nheritage in France, with a long list of \nluminaries that includes Cauchy, Descartes, \nFermat, Galois, Lagrange, Poincaré, \nHadamard, Lebesgue, and the contemporary \ncelebrity Cédric Villani, popularly referred \nto as the “Lady Gaga of mathematics”. He’s \none of 13 Fields Medal winners from France, \nplacing this country second in the world for \nthe honour, just behind the United States.\nThe French system detects budding talent \nand hones it at exceptional math schools \nsuch as the École normale supérieure, \nthe Institut Henri Poincaré, and the Institut \nde Mathématiques de Jussieu. A constant \nstream of highly-educated graduates \nguarantees that France’s industry will \nthrive well into the future.\n \nMath represents 15 percent of France’s GDP, or \n285 billion euros. It has a direct impact on more \nthan two million jobs. Math is crucial to wide \nrange of industries, from building ships to \nmanaging supply chains to virtual prototyping.\nIn addition to math, France is renowned for \nthe excellence of its scientiﬁ c research in \ntop institutions such as the CNRS (National \nCenter for Scientiﬁ c Research), the Inserm \n(National Institute of Health and Medical \nResearch) and the CEA (Alternative Energies \nand Atomic Energy Commission). The CEA \nwas ranked as “world’s number one innovative \ngovernment research organism” in a recent \nThomson Reuters survey. Their research is \nsupported by a dynamic mix of public and \nprivate funding, along with an advantageous \nﬁ scal policy that beneﬁ ts industry, too.\nFrench engineering, envied around \nthe world\nFrance is famous for the quality of its \nengineering schools and takes an \ninterdisciplinary approach to educating \nengineers, of ering a solid base in \ncomputer science along with mechanics, \nlanguages, business management, and \nmore. More than 200 engineering schools \nproduce some 30,000 top-notch \ngraduates per year, and the country counts \nnearly 1.3 million engineers today.\nFrench innovation once again created a buzz \nat CES 2016 in Las Vegas. With 190 startups \non display, France was the second-most \nrepresented country after the United States. \nTwenty of these startups won a CES \nInnovation Award.\n\nCréative Industry Press Kit\nApril 2016\n7\nDesigners making a dif erence  \nThroughout history, France has been home \nto great artists and designers. These days, \nmany are applying their skills to industry, \nhelping companies to come up with \nattractive, pragmatic, and user-friendly \nproducts of all kinds. \nFollowing in the footsteps of Philippe \nStarck, a new generation of French design \nstars has emerged, such as Patrick Jouin, \nwhose ecologically-driven creations \ninclude the “Vélib” bicycle, or the \nBouroullec brothers, who recently \ndesigned a television for Samsung.\nAlso trained in excellent schools, French \ndesigners know how to combine \npragmatism and sensitivity. They have a \nknack for responding to commissions with \npractical solutions that remain pleasing to \nthe touch or the eye. Their work now \nappears in every sector—product design, \ndigital technology, green business, new \ncomposite materials for automobiles and \naeronautics. This trend will continue to grow \nas companies ﬁ nd that ﬁ rst-rate design helps \nthem rise above the competition.\nFrench entrepreneurs—striking out on \ntheir own and succeeding \nThere is a boom of entrepreneurship in \nFrance, notably among the young \ngeneration. Today, 19 million French people \nsay they would like to start their own \nbusiness, and every year 500,000 take \nthe plunge. Those between the ages 18\nand 34 are particularly enthusiastic—more \nthan half express a strong entrepreneurial \ndesire and 34 percent plan to strike out\non their own in the next two years.\nThat’s 3 million new entrepreneurs by 2018.\nFrench entrepreneurs of all ages succeed \nat home and overseas. Joséphine Goube, \n27, lives in the UK and tops the Forbes list \nof the 30 most inﬂ uential personalities \nunder 30 in the category “social \nentrepreneur.” New York-based internet \nentrepreneur Fabrice Grinda is a super \nangel, with more than 200 investments \naround the world.
