Whilst it provides a \ncrucial foundation, it is now viewed as being unable to reflect - by itself - the complicated \nnature of companies and their contribution to value creation. \n \n A wealth of academic research has laid the groundwork and offers up theoretical options \nand experimental solutions that inform the progress of extra-financial information. \n \n There are a plethora of private standard setting initiatives and some of them are turning \ntheir leader organisations into global “standard-setters”. \n \n A number of European public authorities have rolled out ambitious initiatives and the \nEuropean Union has shown a real desire to move things forward although it has not yet \nventured into the sphere of detailed standard setting. The situation is more nuanced \nelsewhere in the world. \n \n Through an exemplary approach, some companies and certain non-governmental \norganisations have introduced particularly proactive strategies.  \nNumerous frameworks have emerged and they provide possible solutions to structure the \ncontent of extra-financial information although standards have not yet converged: \n General frameworks represent substantial progress in terms of content but could still be \nimproved. \n \n Sector or industry standards do have practical advantages but may be somewhat \nsimplistic, especially if they are slated to replace general frameworks.  \n \n Climate-related theme-based frameworks have progressed significantly meaning that \nconvergence can be considered.  \n \n \n \n\n-12- \n \n Other theme-based frameworks covering environmental issues (other than those focusing \non the climate, social affairs and governance matters) are less mature and are still overly-\ngeneral in nature. \n \n Frameworks covering intangibles seem to have stalled. General frameworks focus more \non risks than opportunities or positive contributions. Collective thinking on companies’ \nmeans of value creation, which is central to understanding the business world, has \ndifficulty expressing itself in the shape of relevant extra-financial information. \n \n Many stakeholders are advocating a convergence and stabilisation of standards. \nExtra-financial reporting is a rapidly growing trend, but this progress is coming up against \nmajor operational issues: \n Although it would appear that the general quality standards used for the various \nframeworks could possibly converge, reporting structures are both complicated and \nfragmented. The clarity of extra-financial information suffers as a result. \n \n Due to a lack of public standardisation, the numerous options on offer generate excessive \nflexibility, which hampers comparisons. \n \n In spite of the barriers, issuers are giving real momentum to extra-financial reporting. \nThis phenomenon is heightened by the marshalling of investors who are themselves \nlooking to meet the expectations of their principals and who are faced with issues \nconcerning the quality and relevance of extra-financial data.  \n \n External control of extra-financial information has not been mainstreamed but \nmethodological resources can be developed in the short-term. To date, extra-financial \ndata    has not provided a strong level of assurance.  \n \n Downstream oversight has not yet been used to the full extent of its usual capabilities as \nregards supporting and verifying practices. \n \n Rating agencies are striving to provide appropriate resources but are being held back by \noperational issues, the lack of reliable enough basic data and strategic challenges.  \nWhilst the momentum we are witnessing is very real, it is still delicate as extra-financial data \nremains broadly incomplete and cannot be easily compared as it comes up short in terms of \nquality. \nExtra-financial information is beset by a lack of overall consistency, quality and legitimacy. \nThis situation calls for action as, if a decisive step forward is not taken, the momentum could \nprove to be short-lived. \n \n \n\n-13- \n \nThe way-forward and proposals \nMaking real progress based on the momentum already underway means that four aspects \nmust be formulated: the goal, the methodology, the targeted system (in four pillars) and the \noperational organisation. \nThe suggested goal is simple to state, but sets an objective that is commensurate with the \nchallenge: \"to provide all corporate stakeholders with high-quality extra-financial \ninformation to assess their contribution to sustainable economic, financial and social \ndevelopment\". \nIn terms of methodology, we can and should learn from accounting standards while factoring \nin any specificities and complexities that are inherent to a new and different field. Five \nactions are possible: \n Act at all relevant levels. The various levels (global, European Union, national) can be \nused as part of a \"gradual convergence\" scenario. For each level, convergences can be \norganised based on points of agreement. Even if the EU level appears to be relevant for \nthe development of extra-financial information to meet the suggested goal, the global and \nnational levels are sources of major developments. \n \n Establish a realistic action plan to integrate initial achievements and create added value \nby carrying out successive syntheses based on a strict \"critical path\". The idea is to use \nsyntheses to combine the best available elements with a catalytic reaction that introduces \nnew elements. \n \n Right from the start, introduce into the development process possibilities offered by \ninformation technologies, as well as the constraints arising from them. \n \n Achieve public legitimacy for the principles and standards used in preparing extra-\nfinancial reporting. The aim is to ensure that the framework is clarified by public \nacknowledgement, which implies an appropriate institutional process and restrictions on \nflexibility (although various levels of requirements and/or options are provided for). \n \n Provide impetus for the process by combining proportionality, voluntary action and \nexemplarity. Much progress needs to be made because the goal is far-reaching. Progress \ncannot be decreed, it must be organised. Hence the idea of an approach that is tailored to \nthe field and based on incentives using a non-negotiable base. \nThe targeted package is based on four pillars that form the core of a standardised approach: \n Pillar 1 focuses on general quality principles and a general classification of extra-\nfinancial information, both of which can be agreed upon at global level: \n \no General quality principles: \"extra-financial information must provide faithful \nrepresentation, \nand \nbe \nrelevant \n(for \ninvestors \nand \nother \nstakeholders), \nunderstandable, comparable, verifiable, timely and connected to financial \ninformation\". \n\n-14- \n \nThese principles are the result of a synthesis of the principles adopted by the various \navailable frameworks, which converge in many respects. \"Relevance\" should be \nunderstood as incorporating a forward-looking aspect. The inclusion of \"other \nstakeholders\" underscores the fact that information should not only be useful to \ninvestors, although information useful to investors often overlaps with that needed by \nother stakeholders. \no General \nclassification: \ndistinguishing \nbetween \nqualitative \nand \nquantitative \ninformation, supplemented by distinctions based on the type of information \n(governance, strategy, policies and methodologies for qualitative information; \nmonetary, non-monetary for quantitative information) and on their temporality \n(position, dedicated resources, targets/objectives) leads to a general classification \nsystem involving ten categories that facilitates international understanding and \nstructures any detailed taxonomy. \n \n Pillar 2 focuses on content standardisation. It prioritises the European level and can be \npartly driven by international cooperation. It has two dimensions, a general one and a \nsector-specific one: \n \no A general framework of standards forms the basis: it can be structured with several \nlevels of requirements, thus leaving a wide margin for proportionality and voluntary \naction over and beyond a minimum core. An initial version (phase 1) can be \nconsidered for 2021/2022. It should largely be the result of a synthesis of \nachievements, with added value being provided by the organisation in terms of \nstandards combined with public legitimacy. \no Additional sector-specific frameworks are needed to reconcile overall relevance with \nthe need to adapt to each company's activities. Intra-sector comparability is the \nnatural complement to inter-sector comparability. \n \n Pillar 3 focuses on standardisation of presentation, which is essential in terms of \naccessibility and digitisation. There are two basic aspects – a standard format and a \ndetailed taxonomy - and a possible approach: the concept of an international core: \n \no A standardised format is used to organise non-financial information under a clear set \nof headings by providing a single format and ensuring a link with financial \ninformation. A standardised format does not mean standardised content for each \nheading, some of which are intended to remain broadly open. The idea is to allow \nusers to follow a marked-out path. The standardised format can be recommended or \nmandatory. The exemplarity of easy access to data may be sufficient. \no A detailed taxonomy is essential for digitisation. All extra-financial information must \nbe \"tagged\" to enable it to be read and used easily by information technologies. \no The idea of a minimum core could be applied at international level provided that it \nincludes a limited set of essential information and that it does not replace more \ncomprehensive approaches that better reflect the complexity of situations in which \ncompanies find themselves. At European level, this base could correspond to an initial \nlevel of requirements in the event of a fairly broad application of standards. \n \n Pillar 4 deals with accountability: \n \no Governance: extra-financial information must quickly be added to the governance \nmechanisms put in place for financial information. Companies and users have a \n\n-15- \n \nshared interest in ensuring that the development and approval of this information is \norganised at the right level within the company. \no External control: it must be widespread, with the conditions being specified in \nadvance. The quality of extra-financial information cannot be achieved without \nappropriate external controls, which ensure internal rigour and certainty for third \nparties. This is the natural complement to the growing importance of governance in \nthis area. \no Supervision: To provide support and certainty, supervision must be gradually phased \nin. \nImplementation of a project such as this involves setting up an organisation, international \ncooperation to support future efforts and the adoption of a strict timetable: \n European-level standardisation: the idea is to operate in project mode by marshalling the \nnecessary human and financial resources. Although these are successive syntheses that \nbuild on past achievements, the effort required to achieve the proposed bold goal should \nnot be underestimated. For a variety of reasons, the appropriate level is the EU one, \nwithout excluding efforts at global and national levels. \n \n International cooperation: this is necessary for convergence, both between public \nauthorities and with private organisations working on these issues. \n \n Timetable: the urgency of the matter – which has been noted on more than one occasion, \nin particular with respect to climate change – calls for a tight timetable with an initial \ndeadline as early as 2021/2022 and subsequent deadlines of 5 to 7-10 years. \nThe results of a cost-benefit analysis are promising. \nMore generally, and from a more strategic perspective, Europe can be the \"land of choice\" \nfor extra-financial information. Developing this corresponds to a strong sensitivity expressed \nby EU citizens and to the momentum already observed, driven largely by the companies \nthemselves. \nThe proposed goal is an important part of a forward-looking European identity. Achieving it \nwould also be a competitive advantage for Europe and its businesses, particularly as it would \nenable them to build a more inclusive, robust and sustainable economy, with an eye to taking \nfull advantage of ongoing development transitions and attracting investors looking to provide \nlong-term financing. \n \n \n \n\n-16- \n \n20 proposals \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-17- \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-18- \n \n \n \n \n\n-19- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReport \n \n \n \n \n\n-20- \n \n \n \n \n\n-21- \n \nIntroduction \n \nA company's resilience is closely linked to the resilience of the environmental and social \necosystem in which its activities take place. Companies are also stakeholders in their \nenvironment, particularly during times of transition – whether the transition is energetic, \necological, demographic, social or digital. Companies are seen as one of the linchpins of \neconomic and societal development, and rightly so. For this reason, they are both parties to \nand drivers of change. This position and these interactions make companies essential sources \nof information.  \n \nWithin this context, our remit was to study ways of consolidating the development of extra-\nfinancial reporting by companies, so that, in the long run, it gradually takes on a status \ncomparable to that of financial information. According to the terms of the engagement letter, \nthis report aims to define the conditions for the development of high-quality extra-financial \ninformation – enabling companies to effectively manage the ecological, energy and solidarity \ntransitions in their area of activity. In addition, with an eye to providing useful support for \ninvestors and other stakeholders, the report aims to encourage greater harmonisation and \ncomparability of extra-financial information. After an overview of the various existing \nstandards and initiatives, we assess the relevance of extra-financial information in terms of \nquality, reliability, presentation, implementation cost and verifiability, as well as its \nassociation with financial data. \n \nTo meet these objectives, our task force carried out a broad-based consultation, which enabled \nus to identify the existence of an active, committed community. We would like to thank \neveryone (nearly 250 individuals) for their unstinting contributions. Given the time-limit to \nthe assignment, the task force regrets that it was not possible at times to deepen our \nexchanges, all of which deserved further exploration. We also reviewed the extensive \ndocumentation available on the subject. \n \nThe content of the exchanges and the copious documentation confirm the importance of extra-\nfinancial information today, as well as the existence of real prospects for development, such \nthat it can become a full-fledged part of a company's overall information.   \n \nAs part of this, the task force observed the wide range of stakeholders connected with a \ncompany, which makes it difficult to define objectives, quality principles, content and formats \nas well as the operational organisation of extra-financial reporting. The task force's work was \nalso part of the broader context of the growth of sustainable finance, which calls for better \ninformation on the environmental and social impact of economic activities for the purpose of \nredirecting investment and financing flows. \n \nIt should be recalled that, as defined in the engagement letter, extra-financial reporting covers \na broader field of information than climate reporting, although it plays a crucial role in the \nfight against climate change, and as a result is also intended to cover environmental issues \n(including biodiversity), social and governance issues and, more generally, the intangible \naspects of value creation.   \n \nThe purpose of this report is therefore to field proposals for the promotion of an \ninternationally harmonised framework, as part of the completion of the work of the Task \nForce on Climate-Related Disclosures and the many private and public initiatives underway in \n\n-22- \n \nthe EU and beyond. The report also aims, at European level, to define conditions for the \npreparation, governance, audit and supervision of structured extra-financial reporting, which \nhelps investors make decisions in relation to sustainable finance, helps companies as they take \npart in implementing European environmental and social policies and helps all stakeholders \nby meeting civil society's high expectations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-23- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAPTER 1  \nTHE STAKEHOLDERS IN EXTRA-FINANCIAL \nINFORMATION: FROM EARLY COMMITMENTS TO A \nGENUINE FORWARD MOMENTUM  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-24- \n \n1.1 A preliminary observation: at present, financial information is not \nsufficient by itself to reflect a company's complex reality \nThe benefits of undeniable achievements: solid foundations, maturity, stability and \nrecognition  \nThe rich history of financial information has produced undeniable benefits. \nFirst, it has strong, acknowledged foundations. Without claiming to be exhaustive, it is \nuseful for the purposes of our report to recall the main ones: \n Financial accounting is technically reliable, because accounting records set out a \ncompany's transactions in a comprehensive and mathematically accurate manner (a system \nthat, thanks to double-entry bookkeeping and cross-checking, is self-verifying). \n \n It has changed over time:  \n \n− By moving from recording cash-based accounting to accrual accounting; \n− And, more recently, by attaching items of current value (notably fair value) for certain \nactivities to historical cost entries. \n \n By recording all past and expected cash flows, it uses the same standard – a monetary \nstandard – to report not only end-of-period positions (balance sheet), but also on the flows \nthemselves for each period (income statement, cash flow statement). \n \n It is the result of a known and widely-recognised standardisation process – and public \ninstitutions give it a high legal value (\"accounting standards\") and make it mandatory. \n \n Finally, financial information is in direct contact and in harmony with other frameworks \nthat are applicable to the company – in particular law, taxation, management, financing \nand financial markets. It reflects the obligations arising from them and, in return, produces \nthe information necessary for their proper implementation. \n \nSecond, financial reporting has reached a high level of maturity and stability, particularly \nfor public-interest undertakings:  \n \n Over the past twenty years, a proactive standardisation convergence movement has made \nit possible to achieve a reasonable level of compatibility, and therefore comparability, at \ninternational level: \n \n− Since the recognition of the IASB's standardisation work1 by the European Union in \n2002,2 IFRS has gradually positioned itself as the benchmark standard for many \njurisdictions; \n− Endorsement procedures have been put in place in many jurisdictions,3 but local \nvariants remain limited. \n                                                           \n1 www.ifrs.org. \n2 Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002. \n3 See the inventory drawn up by the IASB: “Pocket guide to IFRS Standards: the global financial reporting \nlanguage”. \n\n-25- \n \n− IFRS thus enjoys widespread international recognition: the EU and many countries \nhave adopted the framework, Japan offers the option (chosen by a large proportion of \nlisted companies), and both China and Japan have embarked on a convergence \nprocess.  \n− Only the United States (via the FASB),4 which had initially initiated a convergence \napproach with the IASB, finally abandoned this goal, which, for a number of technical \nand institutional reasons, was seen as too ambitious. It currently has a comprehensive, \nautonomous national mechanism: although convergence is no longer in the works, the \nparties are currently trying to avoid differences between two mechanisms that have \nmany common points. \n− The action plans issued by the IASB and the FASB do not currently make it possible \nto anticipate major changes in current standards in the short term. Both frameworks \ncan therefore be considered stable from the standpoint of the current economic and \nfinancial environment, which itself is stable. This is particularly true for IFRS, which \nrecently completed several important standardisation projects that were needed to \nadapt or finalise the platform: the adoption of IFRS 9 (financial instruments, in \nresponse to the 2008–2009 economic and financial crisis), IFRS 15 (revenue), IFRS \n16 (leases) and IFRS 17 (insurance contracts, currently being finalised). The \nimpression of constant change is in fact due to recent experience (since 2002 for IFRS \npreparers), which cannot be extrapolated to the coming period, except in the case of a \nmajor crisis. \n \nIn addition, at EU level, for companies not covered by IFRS as endorsed, i.e. mainly unlisted \ncompanies, a regularly updated directive5 also introduces a reasonable level of harmonisation. \nThis harmonisation is often wrongly considered to be not far-reaching enough: in reality, a \ncareful examination of its principles shows that they have a good level of coherence and \nrelevance.6 This does not, of course, rule out ongoing efforts to gradually improve the \nframework thus created, particularly to achieve more in-depth accounting harmonisation and \nto promote harmonisation of tax bases. \n \nThis trend towards standardisation has gone hand-in-hand with the globalisation of financial \nmarkets, the growth in international trade and, more generally, economic development. It has \nalso accompanied the development of the EU's internal market, although there is room for \nimprovement. It provides stakeholders (companies, investors and financiers, among others) \nwith a stable platform that consists of two main accounting \"languages\": IFRS and US Gaap, \nwhich are relatively closely related and enshrined by mutual recognition. In many respects, \nthese two languages are based on a shared economic and financial culture. \n \n \n                                                           \n4 www.fasb.org. \n5 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013. \n6 \"Summary report of the public consultation on the fitness check on the EU framework for public reporting by \ncompanies 21 March-31 July 2018\", 31 October 2016. \n\n-26- \n \nA positive assessment, but strongly mitigated by its relatively limited scope: increasing \ndisconnection with the reality of businesses and conceptual limits \nAt first glance, accounting standardisation appears to be a largely positive phenomenon. This \nis not the end of the story, however, because the stable accounting platform thus created is \nnow the subject of a series of observations that strongly mitigate this assessment and reduce \nthe scope of the resulting financial information. \nThese observations fall into two categories: a disconnection between accounting translation \nand value, and the conventionally limited nature of accounting relevance. \nThe first observation is that of an unavoidable, growing disconnection between book value \nand intrinsic value: \n There is now a very significant gap between book value and market capitalisation.7 It \nshould be noted that market capitalisation expresses a value for minority shareholders. For \ntransactions that result in control of the company (e.g. a takeover bid), the gap is \nobviously even wider. \n \n This observation highlights a key point: by construction – and despite its robustness – \nfinancial accounting, which records individual transactions and reflects the resulting flows \nand positions, cannot aim to reflect the value of the complex whole that makes up a \ncompany, of which the stock market valuation at a given time is only one expression. The \nwhole is more important than the sum of the parts. \n \n This reminder dispels any illusion of a possible reconciliation between accounting and \nvaluation. Some had wanted to see a more widespread use of a full fair value model as a \nway of achieving this, when in reality \"fair value\" is only one way of valuing assets, \nliabilities and transactions. Even if individual items are valued at fair value, the whole \nremains different from the sum of the parts. These theories – inspired by economic \nschools based on market primacy – are no longer relevant, and the consensus today is that \nfair value should be used only for those activities or transactions for which it is considered \nthe most relevant valuation method. Although the dividing line is sometimes shifting and \nvarious preferences are expressed to determine the predominant or default system: \naccounting standards currently enshrine a \"mixed model\" that combines historical cost and \ncurrent value.8 \n \n Even more revealing, the gap between book values and transaction values is widening in \nmany sectors. There are many reasons for this, but the gap is highest for companies active \nin the field of new information technologies. As a result, there are those who assume, and \nprobably rightly so, that financial accounting, which originated in the industrial economy \nand has been able to adapt to a large extent to the financialisation of the economy and the \ndevelopment of the service sector, is struggling to adapt to an economy in which the \nintangible is prevalent. The more an economy is based on the intangible, the less that \nintangibility it is expressed in financial information. \n \n                                                           \n7 As evidenced, for example, by paragraph 2.13 of the EFRAG report, \"What do we really know about goodwill \nand impairment? A quantitative study\", September 2016.  \n8 Chapter 6 of the IASB's \"Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting\", issued in March 2018, presents the \ntwo main valuation methods. \n\n-27- \n \n This observation naturally leads one to put the scope of financial information into \nperspective, and to confine it to what it is capable of, namely to provide a retrospective \nmeasure of monetary quantities. Many analysts note how they are constantly searching for \ninformation on the companies they analyse that is much broader than that provided by \nfinancial information as codified in accounting standards. \n \n It also leads us to seek reasons for the gap and its variation over time, both retrospectively \nand prospectively. Corporate information is first and foremost a decision-making tool: \nstrategic and management decisions by the management team and its governing bodies, \ndecisions to invest in or finance third parties, decisions by employees to contribute, \ndecisions by customers and suppliers to buy or sell to the company, and so on. Good \ninformation must therefore be as predictive as possible. Therefore, the purpose of seeking \nadditional information is twofold: first, to complete an accounting inventory, which is \nimportant but relative; and second, to identify and analyse the key risks and opportunities \nthat will influence the company's future development and performance. \n \nThe second observation is that of the inherent limitations of financial accounting arising \nout of the concepts and conventions that have been adopted, which explains why, by \nconstruction, financial accounting reflects only part of the complex reality of the company: \n Generally speaking, the primary audience of financial accounting is investors and \ncreditors,9 and it is also seen to be useful to other stakeholders. This bias reflects a \nprimacy of shareholders and, to a lesser extent, of financiers. This is a prism that does not \nnecessarily reflect the complexity and multiplicity of the capital deployed (whether \nfinancial, human, natural, etc.) and does not necessarily meet the expectations of other \nstakeholders. \n \n Accrual accounting10 is based on the key concept of obligation, and its corollary, the \nconcept of control. In addition to past cash flows, it is therefore limited, by agreement, to \nbooking expected cash inflows and outflows resulting from obligations entered into by \nthird parties for the benefit of the company and obligations entered into by the company \nfor the benefit of third parties: these cannot be booked without a legally demonstrable \nobligation. Thus, in particular, everything that is free – free being generally understood as \nthe absence of any counterpart to be provided by the beneficiary – is not currently subject \nto being booked. \n \n The concept of accounting obligation is the subject of normative definitions and a wealth \nof literature that is largely based on contract law. It should be noted that when judgment is \ncalled for, particularly in situations involving the notion of risk and where the reality of \nthe obligation is discussed and debatable, a rather restrictive definition prevails.11 Only \nthen, and not always, uncertainties become a matter for information in the notes: this is \nparticularly the case with possible risks and contingent flows. \n \n                                                           \n9 See paragraph 1.5 of the IASB's \"Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting\", March 2018. \n10 See paragraph 1.17 of the IASB's \"Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting\", March 2018. In chapter 4, \nthe elements of the financial statements depend on the entity's obligations and control over them. \n11 The border between a provision and a contingent liability is dealt with in IAS 37, while IAS 38 addresses the \nborder between capitalised costs and contractual commitments that are not capitalised but are disclosed in the \nnotes. \n\n-28- \n \n Over and beyond the existence of obligations, the relevance of the convention of booking \nat historical cost is a matter of debate: \n \n− On the one hand, it may not accurately reflect current costs \n− On the other hand, it is based on the principle of prudence, which means that losses \nare booked as soon as they are likely, and profits are booked only when they are \nachieved. As a result, this introduces an asymmetry which is seen to be \n\"conservative\".12 \n \n When fair value is required or possible, its basis and use are also topics of discussion: \n \n− In particular, it reflects profits that are not necessarily accompanied by expected cash \ninflows at a given time and that reflect market values that may be volatile and \nrepresentative of certain transactions (\"level 1\" in the event of the existence of a liquid \nmarket) or simply estimates with a significant degree of uncertainty (\"level 2\" or \n\"level 3\" based on simulations)13 and \n− Losses faces the same problems, although to a lesser degree, because historical cost \nand fair value generally coincide when the current value is below the acquisition cost. \n \n In accordance with the principle of prudence and the definitions used for assets, there is \ntherefore a great \"reluctance\" to book intangible assets that the company has created: \n \n− Intangible assets are booked very restrictively: when there is a legally separable asset, \nwhen it generates identifiable future cash flows and only to the extent of the costs \nincurred to create it.14 \n− This results in many intangible assets being left outside the scope of financial \naccounting, even though they are the result of \"significant investments\", which are \nthen booked as expenditure for the period, and are essential to the company's future \nperformance. \n \n On the other hand, acquired intangible assets are generally recognised,15 whether it \nconcerns direct acquisition of an asset, which is booked by the acquiring company, or an \nindirect \"block\" acquisition, which is booked at the level of the consolidation of one \ncompany acquiring another: \n \n− In the above-mentioned cases, separable assets are recognised as such for their \nacquisition value (direct acquisition) or for their estimated market value (indirect \nacquisition). In the event of an indirect acquisition, the residual goodwill is recognised \nas goodwill in the consolidated financial statements, and this general intangible asset, \nwhich cannot be separated, is maintained as an asset as long as it has not lost value.16 \n− Incidentally, in the event of a business acquisition, there is therefore a temporary \nreconciliation between historical cost (cash outflow or equivalent) and fair value (the \nprice agreed for the transaction that is deemed representative of the value). \n                                                           \n12 IAS 37 deals with the asymmetry between booking an asset (which must be virtually certain in accordance \nwith IAS 37.35) and a liability (which must be probable in accordance with IAS 37.13(a)). \n13 The three levels of fair value are described in IFRS 13.72-90. \n14 IAS 38.51. \n15 IAS 38.25-47. \n16 IFRS 3. \n\n-29- \n \n− This leads many observers to point to an accounting paradox insofar as an imbalance \nis created, inevitable in many respects given the conventions adopted, between \n\"created wealth\" and \"acquired wealth\". \n− The debate around this point is still relevant, particularly in the work of the IASB17 \nand the FASB,18 which have initiated discussions on this topic. Some favour a less \nrestrictive recognition of the intangible assets created, but such an approach runs up \nagainst the aforementioned concepts and definitions. Others want to institute a \nsystematic amortisation of goodwill, but this would destabilise the established \nplatform and, more fundamentally, widen the gap mentioned previously. \n− There does not seem to be an obvious \"way out\" in the context of financial accounting. \nOn the other hand, in the first analysis, it lies at the heart of extra-financial \ninformation. \n \nThis twofold observation highlights two essential points about the relevance of financial \ninformation: \n On the one hand, the notion of accounting obligation of legal origin leads to potentially \nsignificant liabilities being overlooked as long as they are only contingent and cannot be \nassociated with probable cash outflows. \n \n On the other hand, the concepts of obligation and control as well as the principle of \nprudence lead to very significant intangible assets – which are only recognised in the \nevent of a transaction – being left outside the scope of financial accounting. \n \nThe lessons of accounting standardisation: complementarity and awareness of \nlimitations \nGiven the achievements and limitations of accounting standards, it is not surprising that \nfinancial information is seen as both necessary and of relative importance. \nThe first question we must ask ourselves, therefore, is: can financial accounting go beyond its \nlimits and become more relevant? \nThe prevailing feeling is that attempts to change the \"accounting paradigm\" today would be \nrisky. Instead, it would be more helpful to retain what has been achieved (even if it means \namending it probably marginally), to boost its relevance and to develop extra-financial \ninformation, in an attempt to achieve an overall coherence between financial and extra-\nfinancial information. \nThis desired coherence arises from the basic idea that risks and opportunities – which cannot \nyet be booked under existing rules – are, in many cases, pre-accounting and pre-financial in \nnature. Changes in expectations, company commitments and new legal obligations may lead \nto the inclusion of elements within the scope of accounting that are not currently so. There is \nthus a continuum and, over time, a transition from extra-financial to financial information. \nThis leads to promoting the overall coherence of information in a spirit of complementarity. \n                                                           \n17 The IASB re-started the debate on the treatment of goodwill following the post-implementation review of IFRS 3. \n18  In October 2018, the FASB included in its research program a project on the monitoring of goodwill and the \nrecognition of certain intangible assets. \n\n-30- \n \nThe second question is: can we take advantage of the lessons of accounting standards to \nachieve a reasonable level of consistency, complementarity and quality when it comes to \nextra-financial information? \nThe general feeling is that, drawing on organisational experience and proven procedures, the \nshift towards developing extra-financial information could be significantly stepped up. \nNevertheless, to take into account what has been or can still be observed in terms of \naccounting standardisation, we should immediately point out that this acceleration must be \nstructured around two main objectives: avoiding the potential pitfalls of any standardisation \nprocess and, above all, being fully aware of the limits of the transition. \nWith regard to the first objective, it seems essential to resolve ex-ante the question of the \nlegitimacy of standards, by avoiding the risk of standards seen as \"ungrounded\". How they \nare drawn up, their conceptual bases, whether to make them optional or mandatory and their \ngradual implementation must factor in the domain, existing accounting cultures, current and \nanticipated technical and sociological developments and, ultimately, the geographical levels at \nwhich they will be implemented (i.e. national, EU, international) – without this being to the \ndetriment of comparability. \nWith regard to the second objective, it seems useful to point out that the development of \nextra-financial information will not solve the question of value. Relevant extra-financial \ninformation is generally seen as a key component in a valuation approach, but it cannot \nreplace it. Here too, individual assessment of each element is not a replacement for an overall \nassessment. This is all the more true as extra-financial information refers – and will continue \nto refer – to a number of measurement standards, which is not the case for financial \ninformation, for which the single standard is monetary. Although the notion of pre-financial \ninformation is given prominence, the shift away from multiple non-monetary measures to a \nmonetary measure is and will remain a challenge. The financial accounting standard-setter \nand the extra-financial accounting standard-setter, regardless of their ambitions and \nproactivity, must avoid trying to stitch together a Frankenstein's monster. \n\n-31- \n \n1.2 A great deal of academic research has paved the way and provides \ncontent \nThanks to the perception of the inadequacies of financial information, but also autonomously, \nacademic research has developed a variety approaches aimed at better understanding the \ncompany, its value creation mechanisms and its interactions with its \"ecosystem\" or civil \nsociety and, as a result, at contributing to better corporate communication. \nThe increasing integration of extra-financial performance into corporate reporting is the \nresult of a proliferation of theoretical developments, which have gradually fed society's \nresponses to the challenges posed by contemporary ecological and social crises (such as \nclimate change, biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation) and attempts to explain the \"value\" \nof companies. \n \nThe concept of externalities at the heart of extra-financial corporate reporting \nTo start with, factoring in the externalities of economic activities has stimulated the growth \nof companies' social and economic responsibility, as described below. \nInitially proposed by Henry Sidgwick in 1880, then Alfred Marshall in 1890, then expanded \nby Arthur Cecil Pigou in 1920 in The Economics of Welfare, the concept of externalities \nmakes it possible to account for non-market interdependencies between utility and \nproduction functions. The existence of external effects, whether direct or indirect, of market \ninteractions (which imply, in the standard representation, a relationship between two \neconomic agents) therefore constitutes a market failure. However, since the agents' decisions \nare based on private costs and benefits resulting from their choices, the presence of \nexternalities gives rise to a gap between private and social costs (borne by the population as a \nwhole): this gap thus reveals a decentralised market balance that does not correspond to a \nstate of Pareto efficiency. \nWe thus distinguish two types of externalities: \n Negative externalities, with the example of pollution being the commonly used; \n Positive externalities such as public transport infrastructure or the education system. \n \nIn addition, the spatial dimension of externalities makes the economic analysis of their \nconsequences a particularly complex tax: Charles Tiebout's (1956) work in this area made it \npossible to define local public goods, representing cases of positive externalities (and thus not \nrival and not exclusive in a given geographical area, which has influenced Paul Krugman's \nwork on the new economy geography). \nThe concept of externalities is thus at the heart of corporate social and environmental \nresponsibility, and particularly of extra-financial reporting. As a tool for providing \ntransparency and guidance for a company, particular its CSR policy, extra-financial reporting \nprovides a means for internalising a company's externalities, with the emphasis placed most \noften on negative externalities (such as pollution), but also on positive externalities (such as \nthe implementation of training programmes). \n \n \n\n-32- \n \nTheoretical trends in extra-financial reporting: the sustainable development model; \nstakeholder theory; the concept of CSR and the rise of socially responsible investment \nAn analysis of theoretical trends that have gradually fueled extra-financial reporting allows us \nto better understand the proliferation of initiatives that have taken place since the second half \nof the 20th century. \nThe sustainable development model \nThe sustainable development model emerged in the early 1970s in the wake of the \ncontemporary reflections on the sustainability of the dominant economic growth model since \nthe Industrial Revolution, the discovery of abundant (and non-renewable) natural resources \nand, in particular, the advent of marginalism based on the work of Jevons and Walras: \n This model questioned the accumulation of productive capital and the seemingly \nunlimited nature of the possibilities of increasing production through extensive \n(demographic) and intensive (boosting capital intensity) growth. \n \n In 1972, the so-called \"Meadows\" report expressed concern about the limits of growth, \ndue to the finite nature of natural resources and increasing damage to the environment. \nThis report was followed by the Brundtland report (1987), which defined the notion of \nsustainable development as adopted by the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992. This \nnow widely accepted definition (\"development that meets the needs of the present without \ncompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\"), emphasises the \nneeds of economic agents (referring to the notion of \"capabilities\" in the sense of Amartya \nSen (2010)), and promotes a more forward-looking analysis of economic growth. \n \n Later, , in line with Solow's (1993) work, the World Bank developed the \"heritage\" \napproach to sustainability, aimed at a broader understanding of wealth (stock), with a \nview to including all the components of capital (i.e. productive capital produced, human \ncapital, natural capital, social and institutional capital) that contribute to the production of \nwell-being for present generations and which can be transferred to the future so that future \ngenerations achieve, in turn, at least equivalent well-being. This approach to sustainability \nhas been adopted by the United Nations Global Compact initiative and its ten key \nprinciples (see section 2.1).  \n \n Finally, the concept of \"planetary boundaries\" (Rockström, 2009; Steffen, 2015)19 \ninforms the sustainable development model, aiming to limit the impact of human activities \nto a level that allows humanity to have access to the essential functions of the biosphere in \na predictable and stable manner. This notion is based on a scientific approach that has \nidentified nine processes and systems that regulate the stability and resilience of the earth \nsystem, which together provide the living conditions on which human societies depend: \n \n− Climate change \n− Biodiversity loss \n− Global disturbances in the nitrogen and phosphorus cycle \n− Land use \n− Ocean acidification \n                                                           \n19 Rockstrom, J. et al.

In France, following the adoption of the \nlaw on new economic regulations (2001), the Grenelle Process was initiated in line with \nthe Triple Bottom Line concept. \n \n The Triple Bottom Line concept was subsequently criticised for not maintaining or \npreserving natural and human capital. As a result, the Triple Depreciation Line concept \nwas developed by Jacques Richard and Alexandre Rambaud in 2015 (see below). \n \nSocially responsible investment \nFinally, socially responsible investment (SRI) in companies that meet so-called \nenvironmental, social and governance criteria has emerged in an economic, political and \ninstitutional context that encourages corporate environmental and social responsibility: \n Over and beyond initiatives taken by companies themselves, the rise of institutional \ninvestors, particularly pension funds, has been a key factor in the development of \ncorporate governance (Aglietta and Reberioux, 2004; Plihon, 2003). \nCSR then emerged as a vector for value creation and corporate transformation. \nPorter and Kramer (2006) have highlighted the interdependence between a company and \nthe territory in which it operates: level of infrastructure, quality of the country's \ngovernance and legislative framework, level of demand from consumers and civil society, \nquality of staff education and training, etc. \n \n This creates favourable or unfavourable conditions for a CSR policy that creates value for \nall stakeholders (see Porter and Kramer, 2011, on shared value). \n \nIntangible capital as a measurement tool \nIntangible capital theories, which initially appeared in an effort to explain the differences in \nvalue between stock market value and book value (Francis and Schipper, 1999; Cazavan and \nJeny, 2004), justified by neoclassical theory (Denison, 1967) and by technological progress, \nbegan to emerge in the 1960s: \n Human capital theory, which was developed by Gary Becker20 in 1964, defines the set \nof productive capacities that an individual acquires through the accumulation of general or \nspecific knowledge and know-how: \n \n                                                           \n20 G. S. Becker, Human Capital, A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, Columbia University Press for the \nNational Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1964 \n\n-35- \n \n− Since the stock of intangible human capital can thus accumulate or degrade, it \nincreases when it is the subject of investment (and vice versa), determining differences \nin productivity and, by assumption, in income, between companies. \n− Gary Becker underlines the inseparability of intangible capital: \"It is fully in keeping \nwith the capital concept as traditionally defined to say that expenditures on education, \ntraining, medical care, etc., are investments in capital. However, these produce human, \nnot physical or financial, because you cannot separate a person from his or her \nknowledge, skills, health, or values the way it is possible to move financial and \nphysical assets while the owner stays put.\"  \n− Moreover, investment in human capital is essentially characterised by training: Becker \ndistinguishes between general human capital, which remains attached to the worker \nindependently of his or her company, and company-specific capital, which increases \nworkers' productivity in the company that trained them but little or no outside it. \n \n The theory of innovation was initially proposed by Joseph Schumpeter (1939), who \nmade a distinction between disruptive and incremental innovation. It was then defined by \nEverett Rogers (1962), who highlighted the five principles determining the diffusion of \ninnovation: \n \n− Relative advantage \n− Compatibility \n− Complexity \n− Trialability \n− Observability. \nThis theory amounts to putting research and development and all intangible assets at the \nheart of the company's performance (Cozzarin, 2003). \n The theory of endogenous growth, an outgrowth of human capital theory, was developed \nby Romer (1986), Lucas (1988) and Barro and Salla i Martin (1995). It is based on the \nidea of self-sustaining growth (contrary to Solow's theory) through the human capital tool \nthat allows technological progress to be considered endogenous. Savings invested in \ntraining thus proves to be a powerful growth accelerator. This theory was extended by \nAmartya Sen (2000) who sees capability theory as an extension of human capital theory, \ntaking into account the role of education without limiting it to the labour market alone.21 \n \n Finally, research on the knowledge economy (Foray and De Perthuis, 1997; Foray, \n2000) has made it possible to characterise the knowledge economy as a continuous \nincrease in the share of intangible capital in productive organisations and through the \nspread of information and communication technologies, which represent the foundations \nof economic growth. \n \n As an extension of economic theory, the development of intangible investments has led \nto the emergence of new theories, known as \"resource-based\", highlighting the role \nof individual and organisational skills in the creation of value and financial \nperformance of companies (Eccles, 1999). The informational power of intangible assets \nhas thus appeared in financial theory and has informed empirical studies on the link \n                                                           \n21 Amartya Sen: \"The benefits of education, thus, exceeds its role as human capital in commodity production. \nThe broader human-capability perspective would record - and value - these additional roles. The two \nperspectives are, thus, closely related but distinct.\"  \n \n\n-36- \n \nbetween investment in research and development and the future profitability of the \ncompany (Lev and Sougiannis, 1996). \n \n Similarly, there are many theoretical contributions from consultants, practitioners and \nmanagement teachers, including those of Edvinsson and Malone22 or Sveiby.23 \nIt is this work that has informed the initiatives on intangible capital that we will discuss later, \nfrom the Thesaurus to the initiatives of the Directorate General for Enterprise and several \nprivate stakeholders (see section 2.4). \n \nNatural capital as a new extra-financial frontier? \nAmong capital other than financial capital, natural capital has been largely ignored by \neconomic analysis, starting from the industrial revolution (Daly, 1994). \nIn a hunter/gatherer economy, then an agricultural economy, production per unit of time was \nconsidered as the return on capital stock – i.e. natural capital – which the work of classical \nand physiocratic economists in the 18th century24 highlighted the central role given to natural \ncapital (land) in the production of the economies of the time. \nThe industrial revolution, followed by the economy's shift towards services, marked a decline \nin the place in the economic system that was assigned to nature. These two phenomena \nshowed that production was the result of the combination of productive capital and labour, \nand that it depended only to a minor extent on natural capital (as illustrated by the work on the \nnational accounts in the 1930s and the Cobb-Douglas production function). According to \nutilitarian and neoclassical theories, natural heritage is considered immutable and unalterable \n(\"since they cannot be multiplied or exhausted, they [natural resources] are not the subject of \neconomics\", as described by Say (1803) in his Treatise on Political Economy). In addition, \nnatural resources have long appeared through intermediate consumption of raw materials, i.e. \nthe market part of what comes from natural capital, and therefore as exogenous data.  \nToday we take a fundamentally different view: \n In the 1970s, with the appearance of the Meadows report (see above) and the oil shocks, \nnature gradually regained a place in economic analysis, in line with the work of Hotelling \n(1931) on the treatment of non-renewable natural resources. \n \n Focus gradually shifted to pollution and nature's ability to assimilate it. \n \n Today, nature is seen as a supplier of goods and services, closely linked to human well-\nbeing (as illustrated by the work of the UN-led Millennium Ecosystem Assessment), and \nconsidered as a whole, although still largely absent from indicators and most economic \nanalyses. \n \n                                                           \n22 L.

Malone: \"Le capital immatériel de l'entreprise: identification, mesure, management\". \nMazars/ Maxima 1999. \n23 KE Sveiby: \"The New Organizational Wealth: Managing and Measuring Knowledge-Based Assets\". \nMazars/Maxima 2000. \n24 Quesnay, 1774 : \"Que le souverain et la nation ne perdent jamais de vue que la terre est l’unique source des \nrichesses\".  \n\n-37- \n \n Natural capital can be considered as an ecosystem that generates flows of \necosystemic goods and services that are used by humans (Ollivier, 2010). This \necosystem is defined by a set of physical, chemical and biological variables (representing \nstocks) that interact with each other to form ecosystem functions that are the basis of \necological services (supply, regulation, cultivation). A distinction is also made between \nthe renewable and non-renewable components of natural capital.  \n \nThe preservation of natural and human capital – the concept of the Triple Depreciation \nLine \nThe Triple Depreciation Line concept was developed by Jacques Richard and Alexandre \nRambaud (2012, 2015). It extends the accounting structure – which was designed to preserve \nfinancial capital through historical cost accounting and planned depreciation – to natural and \nhuman capital. This concept is based on four assumptions: \n The company's use of natural and human capital implies an obligation on the part of the \ncompany to preserve it. Although the use of natural capital may be regulated in some \njurisdictions, uses leading to externalities do not entail an obligation to compensate for the \ndamage caused. \n \n Repeated use of natural and human capital leads to their overexploitation and degradation \n(despite the difficulties of determining thresholds, given the complexity of ecosystems and \nthe multiple interactions between agents); \n \n Reporting on natural and human capital must be fully integrated into companies' financial \nstatements (integrated reporting of natural and human capital), through a combination of \nmonetary and non-monetary data; \n \n Finally, the natural and human capital used by the company is necessary to achieve its \nobjectives (i.e. appropriation of renewable and exhaustible resources, destruction of \necosystems through infrastructure, homogenisation of living systems, etc.), including the \ngeneration of profits.  \nThe Triple Depreciation Line concept thus aims to integrate social and environmental issues \ndirectly into companies' balance sheets and income statements: \n Conceiving of human and natural capital as liabilities (and not assets) with a view to \nunderstanding them as a \"social and ecological debt\" to be maintained or even repaid \n \n Conversely, conceiving human and environmental assets as the uses made of these entities \n(in order to detail their uses) \n \n And thus conceiving the degradation of human beings and environmental entities as an \nearly amortisation (guaranteeing the maintenance of liabilities) \n \nThe Triple Depreciation Line is being implemented via the CARE25 model (discussed in \nsection 1.3). \n                                                           \n25 CARE : Comprehensive Accounting in Respect of Ecology \n\n-38- \n \nExtra-financial reporting as a signal to stakeholders and as a strategic management tool \nAll these theories contribute sustainable development issues being taken into account, \nand even integrated, by and within companies. Companies are committed to assessing and \noptimising their societal impact beyond their legal lifetime, and to taking environmental and \nsocial criteria into account in their investment strategies and activities, regardless of their \ncapital configuration. However, these challenges highlight the sensitive balance between a \ncompany's microeconomic challenges and its more macroeconomic focus on sustainability, \ndifficulties that we will highlight throughout this report. \nNevertheless, non-financial reporting also aims to respond to the concerns of countries' \nsustainable development, in order to encourage companies to report to all stakeholders about \ntheir social and environmental responsibility commitments at the juncture between economic \nprofitability, respect for the environment and social performance. There are a number of \npersistent definitions of the notion of stakeholder, making several theories coexist: \nstakeholders are thus conceived in their broad sense, the one proposed by Freeman (1984), \ndescribed above. \nIt should also be pointed out that Bon (2009) highlighted the difficulties of the terminological \nshift from social responsibility (in the sense of Carroll, 1979: a legal, economic, ethical and \ndiscretionary responsibility) to sustainable development: the company is able to identify and \nsatisfy the expectations of its stakeholders, in a broad sense (Freeman, 1984), but sustainable \ndevelopment remains an issue shared by all (its stakeholders are therefore no longer merely \nbeneficiaries or captives of its policy). However, this should not dilute the company's \nresponsibility or transfer costs to its stakeholders. In addition, Bon (2009) stresses that \nsustainable development \"cannot be decreed, it must be built\", thus insisting on the collective \nreflection specific to the challenges of the company that constitutes a sustainable development \npolicy. \nSeveral lessons can be learned from the academic research and theoretical developments that \nwe have briefly touched: \n The company constantly interacts with a complex set of stakeholders, and its \nresilience depends on the environmental and social ecosystem in which its activities \ntake place \n \n This resilience implies a good knowledge and effective consideration of all the \ncompany's risks and opportunities \n \n Each company is unique, and if it seems natural and fundamental to treat extra-\nfinancial reporting from the perspective of sustainable development in the general \ninterest, the company must communicate on all its interactions: it is an \"object\" of \ninformation, but also an \"actor\" in its environment \n \n Reporting must not only be static, but also dynamic, especially at a time of major \ntransitions: energetic, ecological, demographic, social and digital. \n \nThe construction of extra-financial reporting must be seen in the wake of the theoretical \ndevelopments in social and environmental responsibility and stakeholder theory as described \nabove. Extra-financial reporting also benefits from a rich history and intense regulatory \nactivity, which we will cover in section 1.3. \n\n-39- \n \n1.3 The European Union expresses political will to make progress in this \narea: from pioneering initiatives to fresh impetus \nPioneering efforts in the 1990s and 2000s \nIn 1993, Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, called on European \ncompanies to take part in the fight against social exclusion by joining a European Business \nNetwork for Social Cohesion. This launched the development of the issues of sustainable \ndevelopment and corporate responsibility – as well as the associated regulations within the \nMember States. In March 2000, the Lisbon European Council called for a sense of corporate \nresponsibility in the area of social and sustainable development. In the United Kingdom, in \nMarch 2000, the Blair government appointed a Minister for Corporate Social Responsibility. \nAt international level, it is worth noting that the United Nations Global Compact (see section \n1.5) was created in 2000. The International Labor Organization (ILO) issued its Tripartite \nDeclaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy (1997-\n2000), followed by the OECD's publication of its Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. \nIn July 2001, the European Commission published its Green Paper, \"Promoting a \nEuropean framework for Corporate Social Responsibility\". This laid the foundation for a \nEuropean CSR policy in an economic area that was then integrated and open to international \ncapital to mitigate any risk of unfair competition and to promote, beyond its borders, a \nEuropean model that respects internationally recognised social, environmental and economic \nstandards. \nIn particular, the Green Paper stated that: \n \"Corporate social responsibility is essentially a concept whereby companies decide \nvoluntarily to contribute to a better society and a cleaner environment\" and \n \n \"Although the prime responsibility of a company is generating profits, companies can at \nthe same time contribute to social and environmental objectives.\" It should be noted in \nthis respect that the European Parliament, in its resolution quoted below, stressed that \nCSR should not only be an optional supplement to the normal activities of the company, \nbut \"should become an essential part of the activity of all companies\". \n \nIn 2002, The European Parliament published its report on the Green Paper – the recitals of \nwhich illustrate the proliferation of initiatives on the subject at European level at the \ntime, as well as the high degree of anticipation by MEPs of the debates that currently \nconcern us on extra-financial corporate reporting:  \n\"The European Parliament […]: \n Considers that social and environmental practice by European companies should be \nsubjected to similar scrutiny as competitive practices; […]  \n Encourages the Commission to elaborate a broad and more precise definition of \ncorporate social responsibility, not as a marginal concept but as a key objective for a \nfuture-oriented company policy, and guiding principle for European socio-economic \npolicies; \n Invites the Commission to bring forward a proposal […] for social and environmental \nreporting to be included alongside financial reporting requirements.\" \n\n-40- \n \n \n All the recommendations adopted by the above-mentioned international and Community \nbodies are based on the principle of consensual management – their application \nrequiring close consultation between various stakeholders – and enshrine the role of \neconomic power in the formation of the general interest, without however, at this \nstage, putting forward a normative approach. \n \n France's approach was a pioneer in this field, with the adoption of the law on new \neconomic regulations (known as the \"NRE Act\") on 15 May 2001. \n \nAn overview of French regulatory initiatives: from CSR reporting to extra-financial \nperformance reporting, a strategic management tool for companies \nIn France, the growth in extra-financial corporate reporting since the late 1990s has been \naccompanied by an increase in the regulation of this reporting. Following the enactment of the \nDirective 2014/95/UE dated 22 October 2014 amending the accounting directive as regards \ndisclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups \ninto French law, reporting now benefits from a significant regulatory framework covering all \nenvironmental, social and societal issues.26 \n \nAs a reminder, the management report (which as such does not have a legal definition, \ndespite the fact that its content is precisely defined by law) is the document by which the \n                                                           \n26 Order No. 2017-1180 of 21 July 2017, for the purpose of enacting the non-financial Directive in French law, \namended Articles L. 221-7, L. 225-37-4, L. 225-102-1, L. 823-10, L. 950-1 and R. 225-104 and R. 225-105 to R. \n225-105-2 of the French Commercial Code, L. 511-35 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, L. 322-26-2-\n4 of the French Insurance Code, L. 931-7-3 of the French Social Security Code, L. 114-17 of the French Mutual \nInsurance Code, L. 524-2-1 of the French Rural and Maritime Fisheries Code and Article 8 of the Law of 10 \nSeptember 1947 on the status of cooperatives, repealed Article L. 931-7-5 of the French Social Security Code \nand created Article L. 310-1-1-1 of the French Insurance Code. \n2001 – 2016 \n2001 NRE Act \nfollowed by the \n\"Grenelle II\" \ninitiative in 2010 \nand the Order of \nApril 2012 \n2016  \nGrenelle II  \n+ Energy Transition and \nGreen Growth Act \n(LTECV)  – provisions \ngoverning the circular \neconomy and climate \nchange \n+ Food Waste Prevention \nAct / Biodiversity Act \n2017 \nGrenelle II  \n+ loi TECV et article 173 \n+  Food Waste Prevention \nAct / Biodiversity Act \n+ Due Diligence Act  \n+ Sapin II Act (art. 17) \n2018 \nDeclaration of \nextra-financial \nperformance \n+ Due Diligence \nAct  \n+ Sapin II Act \n(art.17) \n \n\n-41- \n \nentity's managers and governing bodies report to the legislative body on their management \nduring the past financial year and communicate all material information about the entity and \nits outlook. It is prepared by the same bodies as those responsible for the company's annual \nfinancial statements (i.e. balance sheet, income statement, notes), which the management \nreport is intended to accompany. All listed and unlisted commercial companies (except for \nthose meeting the definition of small companies, which are exempt from preparing a \nmanagement report for the financial years ending on or after 11 August 2018) and private \nlegal entities not engaged in commercial activity are required to prepare a management report. \nThe management report should not be confused with: \n \n The reference document: companies whose shares are listed for trading on a regulated \nmarket or multilateral trading facility may prepare an annual reference document that sets \nout the company's organisation, activity, financial situation, results and outlook \n(established by AMF Instruction DOC-2016-04, based on the 2004 Prospectus Regulation, \nArticles 212-13, 222-2 and 222-9 of the general regulations of the AMF and the \nrecommendations of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)). This \ndocument, which also facilitates financial market transactions, may form an integral part \nof the prospectus (in the context of a capital increase, or an issue or an admission of \nfinancial securities, and subject to prior approval by the AMF). \n \n The annual report, also codified by the AMF, which listed companies must publish \nwithin three months of the end of their financial year. The annual report includes the \nannual financial statements, the management report and any information likely to have an \nimpact on the share price. \n \n The many other reports that companies publish voluntarily, without any legal or \nregulatory constraints of form and content (such as a sustainable development report or a \nhealth, safety and environment report, etc.), or as part of a regulated framework (i.e. \nsocial audit, gender equality report). \n \nA significant change in the French regulatory context since the early 2000s \n At a time when there is international and European encouragement for companies to \nbecome involved in sustainable development, Article 116 of the NRE Act of 15 May \n2001 structured and made mandatory the framework for listed companies in terms of the \nextra-financial reporting in their management reports (an obligation that was codified in \nArticle L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code). This has thus increased the volume \nof information to be provided and extended its scope to the largest companies in the \ncommercial, financial, mutual insurance, cooperative and benefits sectors. \n \n Article 225 of the Act of 12 July 2010 concerning a national commitment to the \nenvironment (the \"Grenelle II\" Act) subsequently extended this mechanism by \nsupplementing Article 116 of the NRE Act by adding a social pillar and broadening the \nscope of the companies concerned (i.e. those not listed on a regulated market – public \nlimited companies (SA), partnerships limited by shares (SCA) and limited European \ncompanies (SE)). It also expanded the scope by creating, a regulatory list for listed \ncompanies with 42 reporting items (for financial years starting after 31 December 2011). \nThis article also required mandatory data checking by an independent third-party body.  \n \n\n-42- \n \n The decree of 24 April 2012 relating to corporate transparency obligations in social \nand environmental matters, codified in the French Commercial Code, introduced new \nelements to extra-financial reporting: \n \n− Extension of the scope of companies required to submit mandatory reports to unlisted \ncompanies with more than 500 employees and whose annual turnover or balance sheet \ntotal exceeds 100 million euros, \n− Increase in the information required to 42 items grouped under three themes: social \n(employment, labour relations, health and safety), environment (pollution and waste \nmanagement, energy consumption) and sustainable development commitments (social \nimpacts, relations with stakeholders, respect for human rights, etc.), \n− Introduction of the concept of \"comply or explain\". Companies may choose to omit \ninformation on certain subjects but must justify the non-disclosure, \n− The report must provide information about actions taken by the company and its \nsubsidiaries, and must be submitted to a third party auditor. \n \n Entering into force on 30 December 2015, the Decree n° 2015-1850 related to Article \n173-VI of the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act (LTECV) requires investment \nmanagement companies and the entities mentioned in the third paragraph of Article L. \n533-22-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code to publish information on how ESG criteria, \nparticularly concerning climate risks, are taken into account with respect to investment \npolicy and on the means implemented to contribute to the energy and ecological \ntransition27. The decree sets out the information to be published concerning these criteria \nand specifies the climate-related information that can be issued. The financial stakeholders \ncovered by the decree must describe how they take these issues into account and, where \napplicable, indicate that they do not take them into account. However, no specific method \nis imposed. This allows a diversity of approaches to be taken, depending on the \nnature of the activities and the investment typologies of each stakeholder. \n \n The Decree of 19 August 2016 adopted pursuant to Article 173-IV of the LTECV and \nthe Food Waste Prevention Act of 11 February 2016 (notably Article 4) amended \nArticle R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code relating to environmental information \ncontained in companies' management reports and added two elements: \n \ni. \nRelating to the circular economy, with actions to combat food waste (i.e. measures \nfor prevention, recycling, reuse and other forms of waste recovery and disposal) \nii. \nWith regard to climate change, Article 173-IV incorporates the notion of reporting \non significant greenhouse gas emissions generated by the company's activity, in \nparticular through the use of the goods and services it produces. \n \nDrafting and adopting the non-financial directive: an essential first step towards \nharmonisation \nDirective 2014/95/EU of 22 October 2014 as regards disclosure of non-financial and \ndiversity information by certain large undertakings and groups, known as the \"Non-Financial \n                                                           \n27 In this respect, Article 173-VI amended and extended to institutional investors the provisions of Article L. \n533-22-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code introduced by Article 224 of the Grenelle II Act. Until \nthen, the Grenelle II framework was indeed applicable to portfolio management companies of UCITS and certain \nalternative investment funds. \n\n-43- \n \nDirective\", introduced a social and environmental reporting obligation at European level (it \ncame into force on 1 January 2018). \nThis Directive is part of a context that included the European Commission's publication of the \na communication entitled \"A renewed EU strategy 2011-14 for Corporate Social \nResponsibility\", which was adopted in October 2011, as well as a series of European \nParliament resolutions on the subject in 2013. There was also, in light of the growing number \nof national initiatives within the EU, a need for coordination, in particular for companies \noperating in more than one Member State. \n \nIt amends Directive 2013/34/EU of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, \nconsolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings (the \n\"Accounting Directive\"), particularly through the insertion of Article 19a on the non-\nfinancial reporting of EU-based public-interest entities with more than 500 employees, at \nconsolidated level (including listed companies, credit institutions and insurance companies). It \nalso amends Article 20 (\"Corporate Governance Statement\") by supplementing it with \nelements relating to diversity (including age, gender, and educational and professional \nbackgrounds) and Article 29 (\"Consolidated Management Report\") by supplementing it with \nArticle 29a entitled \"Consolidated Non-Financial Statement\". This is the first European \ndirective to set out the way forward in non-financial reporting, and its enactment into national \nlaw has required some adjustments to existing legislation. \n \nMoreover, recital 9 of the Directive states that: \n \n\"In providing this information, undertakings which are subject to this Directive may rely on \nnational frameworks, Union-based frameworks such as the Eco-Management and Audit \nScheme (EMAS), or international frameworks such as the United Nations (UN) Global \nCompact, the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights implementing the UN \n‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ Framework, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the International \nOrganisation for Standardisation's ISO 26000, the International Labour Organisation's \nTripartite Declaration of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy, \nthe Global Reporting Initiative, or other recognised international frameworks.\" \n \nOn 5 July 2017, the European Commission published its guidelines for the inclusion of a \nnon-financial statement in the management report - thereby clarifying how the 2014 \nDirective will be implemented and taking into account the Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDG) and the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The basic principles of the guidelines are as \nfollows: \n \n Publish material information:28 here, the materiality of the information published is at \nissue. This depends on the company's business model, strategy and primary risks, sectoral \nissues, the interests and expectations of the stakeholders concerned, the impact of the \ncompany's activities, particularly in relation to its supply chain, and public policies and \nregulatory incentives. \n \n                                                           \n28 Under the terms of Article 2, paragraph 16 of the 2013 Accounting Directive, \"material\" means the status of \ninformation where its omission or misstatement could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that users \nmake on the basis of the financial statements of the undertaking. The materiality of individual items shall be \nassessed in the context of other similar items. \n\n-44- \n \n Information must be faithful, balanced and understandable (i.e. the role of corporate \ngovernance systems, the strength and reliability of data and internal control systems, \ninteraction with stakeholders and independent external audits), as well as logical and \nconsistent. \n \n Complete and concise information, targeted at stakeholders \n \n A strategic and forward-looking vision.  \n \nThe guidelines are based on a variety of existing national, European and international \nframeworks, which are detailed in the Appendixes 4, 5 and 9). \n \nAn enactment of the Directive that gives concrete form to a structuring approach but \nthat reveals varying sensitivities \nIn France, the Order of 19 July 2017 relating to the publication of non-financial information \nby certain large undertakings and groups and its implementing decree of 9 August 2017 have \nchanged the extra-financial reporting system.29 As from 1 September 2017, companies must \nformalise a non-financial statement. This must be included in the management report \n(approved by the Board of Directors or the Management Board), presented to the General \nMeeting of Shareholders (within six months of the end of the financial year) and made public.  \n The non-financial statement thus aims to be a strategic management tool for the \ncompany, focusing on material information. \n \n The risk-based approach is at the heart of the reporting system. In addition, the so-called \nprinciple of relevance (i.e. \"materiality\") has been bolstered, in comparison with \nexhaustiveness: a list of detailed information is mentioned under the new system, but is \nonly required in the statement on extra-financial performance if it is relevant to the main \nrisks and policies identified. Justifications for absence now focus on the absence of a \npolicy with regard to a given risk (\"comply or explain\"). \n \nScope of information required by the non-financial statement: the materiality approach \n Companies are no longer required to complete a precise, predetermined list of extra-\nfinancial information that is identical for all companies. Under the terms of Article L. 225-\n102-1 of the French Commercial Code,30 the scope of the information concerned is as \nfollows: \n \n− The company's business model (or, where applicable, of all companies for which the \ncompany prepares consolidated financial statements) \n− Information on the primary risks relating to major extra-financial themes \n(environmental information about the company's activity (i.e. climate change, the \ncircular economy, combating food waste) and taking into account the social \nconsequences of the company's activity) \n                                                           \n29 Via amendments to Articles L. 225-102-1 and R. 225-104 to R. 225-105-2 of the French Commercial Code d \n(initially introduced by Article 225 of the Grenelle II Act of 2010 and its 2012 implementing decree) \n30 Independent Third Party Organisations must certify that the statement of extra-financial performance is \nincluded in the management report (See Section 5.1) \n\n-45- \n \n− Policies and the procedures implemented to carry out those policies and their results  \n− Key performance indicators \n \nIt should be noted that for companies listed on a regulated market, the DPEF must include \ninformation on the effects of the company's activity in terms of respect for human rights \nand anti-corruption efforts. \n \n In particular, it is noted that: \n \n− If the company does not apply a policy with respect to one or more of these risks, the \nstatement shall include a clear and reasoned explanation of the reasons for doing so. \n− Much of the information noted above must be included among the risk factors in a \ndedicated section in the 2004 Prospectus Regulation, provided that they have a \nmaterial financial impact. \n− By reference to Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code, the same scope \napplies to financial and extra-financial information (i.e. continuity in the approach \nwith respect to the scope of consolidation). The scope of consolidation includes the \nparent company, the companies it exclusively controls and any jointly-controlled \ncompanies: exemptions must be presented and justified in the statement of extra-\nfinancial performance.  \nEntities concerned \n The entities concerned are of two kinds: \n \n− Listed companies (whose shares are listed for trading on a regulated market. These \ninclude public limited companies (SAs), partnerships limited by shares (SCAs), \nEuropean companies with their registered offices in France, general partnerships, \nfinance companies, investment companies, parent companies of finance companies, \nfinancial holding companies when they take one of the above-mentioned legal forms) \nand similar companies (i.e. credit institutions, insurance companies), if their net \nturnover exceeds 40 million euros or their balance sheet total exceeds 20 million \neuros. \n− Unlisted companies (public limited companies (SAs), partnerships limited by shares \n(SCAs), SCEs, general partnerships (SNCs), credit institutions, finance companies, \ninvestment companies, parent companies of finance companies, financial holding \ncompanies regardless of their legal structure, mutual insurance companies, cooperative \ncompanies, benefits institutions, mutual companies and mutual associations), whose \nnet turnover or balance sheet total exceeds 100 million euros. \nSince 2017, there has been both an exemption for certain \"listed\" SMEs and certain \nsubsidiaries, as well as an inclusion of other entities (i.e. assessment of eligibility \nthresholds at consolidated level; integration of public interest entities and certain \nbenefits institutions). \nIn addition, several recent pieces of legislation have strengthened the regulatory framework \nresulting from the Directive, thus helping to broaden the scope of reporting required from \ncompanies:   \n \n The so-called “Sapin II” Act of 9 December 2016, which updated the French legal \nframework by incorporating commonly-accepted principles in the fight against \ncorruption. It requires the companies concerned and their managers to put in place, as \n\n-46- \n \nfrom 1 June 2017, measures and procedures to combat corruption by adopting a risk \nprevention approach (Article 17) \n \n The Due Diligence Act of 27 March 2017, which requires the companies concerned to \nestablish and implement a due diligence plan that includes the companies they control, \nsubcontractors and suppliers with whom the parent entity or ordering company has an \nestablished commercial relationship. \n \n The Career Choice Act of 5 September 2018 (in particular Article 84) requires the \ncompanies concerned by this Act to provide information about measures taken in \nsupport of people with disabilities;  \n \n The Act of 30 October 2018 on the balance of trade relations in the agricultural and food \nsector and promoting healthy, sustainable and accessible food for all (notably Article 55) \nrequires the companies concerned to report on the means taken to combat food \ninsecurity, respect for animal welfare and responsible, equitable and sustainable \nfood; and \n \n The Anti-Fraud Act of 23 October 2018 (notably Article 20 thereof) requires the \ncompanies concerned by the law to communicate on the effects of their activity on the \nfight against tax evasion (i.e. primary risks related to the activity; due diligence \nprocedures; key performance indicators). \nIn the other European Union countries, the enactment of the Directive has revealed \ndifferences between Member States in terms of the scope given to extra-financial \nreporting \n The enactment of Directive 2014/95/EU into Member States' legislation between 2015 \nand 2017 revealed differences between EU Member States in the scope of the companies \nconcerned, the scope of application in terms of indicators and information to be provided, \nthe structure and format of the reporting, and the audit and penalties applicable in the \nevent of non-compliance. It should be noted that France stands out due to its more \nforward-looking stance with respect to extra-financial reporting, while Germany is \nrather more conservative (see summary table in Appendix 5). Nevertheless, several \nMember States have exceeded the Directive's scope of companies with 500 or more \nemployees, in particular Sweden, Denmark and Greece. In terms of reporting scope, \nFrance and Italy have introduced additional requirements. Only France and the United \nKingdom require the inclusion of extra-financial reporting in the management report. \n \n It should be noted that only two of the Directive's requirements have not been taken into \naccount by a number of Member States when enacting them into national law: \n \n− The penalties for non-compliance recommended in Article 51 of Directive \n2013/34/EU on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and \nrelated reports of certain types of undertakings (\"Member States shall provide for \npenalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted in accordance \nwith this Directive and shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that those \npenalties are enforced. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and \ndissuasive\") have not been enacted in Estonia, the Netherlands and Spain. \n \n\n-47- \n \nIn all other Member States, the enactment of Article 51 has been adapted to each \ncountry's particular context. Thus, in Germany the applicable penalty may be a fine of \n10 million euros or 5% of the company's total annual turnover or twice the gains made \nas a result of non-compliance. In a large number of Member States, the applicable \npenalties are specified in the country's commercial code (or equivalent) or civil code. \nIn Malta, for example, the penalty applies to the individual held liable, for an amount \nof 1,164 euros, while in Portugal, the penalty also applies to the individual held liable \nfor an amount between 50 and 1,500 euros. In the United Kingdom, the penalty (the \namount of which is defined on a case-by-case basis) also applies to the individual held \nliable. \n− The so-called \"safe harbor principle\" is established in Article 19a: \"Member States may \nallow information relating to impending developments or matters in the course of \nnegotiation to be omitted in exceptional cases where, in the duly justified opinion of \nthe members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies, acting within \nthe competences assigned to them by national law and having collective responsibility \nfor that opinion, the disclosure of such information would be seriously prejudicial to \nthe commercial position of the undertaking, provided that such omission does not \nprevent a fair and balanced understanding of the undertaking's development, \nperformance, position and impact of its activity\". Denmark, Estonia, France, Norway \nand Slovakia have not enacted this clause. In France, this provision has not been \nincluded because of the existence of the \"comply or explain\" clause, which is \nconsidered sufficient. \n \n Also of interest are the UK’s initiative regarding the update of its Strategic Report and the \nrecommendations issued by the FRC in 2018 following the European directive on non-\nfinancial information (see Appendix 5). The Strategic Report centralises all information \nthat will be included in the management report.  \n \nThe European Commission's action plan for sustainable finance and the evolution of \nextra-financial reporting \nWith its action plan on financing sustainable growth published on 8 March 2018, the \nEuropean Commission has – 25 years after President Delors' call for European companies to \nbe more social responsible – once again laid the foundations for a stronger European Union \ncommitment to sustainable development. The plan promotes sustainable finance as a \nreference framework for the regulation and functioning of European financial markets. This is \none of the priorities of the Capital Markets Union and the EU's climate action and sustainable \ndevelopment programme. This plan is also largely based on the report by the High-Level \nExpert Group on Sustainable Finance (HLEG), published on 31 January 2018. \nThis action plan has three objectives: \n(i) \nReorient capital flows towards sustainable investment, in order to achieve \nsustainable and inclusive growth (i.e. close the annual investment gap required \nto achieve the European Union's 2030 climate and energy objectives) \n(ii) \nManage financial risks stemming from climate change, environmental \ndegradation and social issues (in line with the risk typology described by Mark \nCarney in September 2015) \n(iii) \nFoster transparency and long-termism in financial and economic activity \n \n\n-48- \n \nOn this last point, the Commission highlights the key role of corporate extra-financial \nreporting in providing a real long-term vision of economic activities: \n\"Transparency of market participants' activities is essential to a well-functioning financial \nsystem. Corporate transparency on sustainability issues is a prerequisite to enable financial \nmarket actors to properly assess the long-term value creation of companies and their \nmanagement of sustainability risks. Corporate reporting is ineffective when longer-term risks \nare not fully transparent and thus cannot be taken into account. Corporate transparency on \nsustainability will not only inform market participants, but also help to steer companies in a \nmore sustainable and long-term direction. […]In this context, the Commission welcomes and \nencourages private initiatives on disclosure that promote easily accessible information on \nsustainable finance. Sustainability and long-termism go hand in hand.\"31 \n \nIt is against the backdrop that the action plan launched two initiatives to boost extra-financial \ncorporate reporting: \n Revision of the guidelines on non-financial information (by Q2 2019), by including \nan annex dedicated to climate reporting \n \nThe Commission's objective: to adapt its guidelines to the recommendations of the \nTCFD, to achieve greater convergence between financial and extra-financial \ninformation \n \nThe Commission's objective is to adapt the guidelines to the recommendations of the \nTCFD as well as to the future classification of sustainable economic activities (the draft \nTaxonomy Regulation). Without clear and reliable extra-financial information, the \nCommission emphasises that the financial sector is poorly positioned to redirect its \ninvestments towards sustainable sectors and companies.  In this way, the Commission \nrecalls the benefits expected from greater transparency in the extra-financial area (a better \nunderstanding of the risks and opportunities faced by companies, lower cost of capital \nthrough better allocation of investments, controlled reputation risk, etc.). \n \nAs part of this, the Commission has entrusted the Technical Expert Group on Sustainable \nFinance (TEG) with the task of studying revision of the guidelines and drawing \nconclusions from them to inform the Commission's future work. This expert group \npublished a progress report in early 2019, which was submitted for consultation. Seventy \nrespondents commented on its proposals and the Commission used the TEG's conclusions \nand reactions to them to develop the annex to the climate guidelines (which should be read \nin conjunction with national texts enacting Directive 2014/95/EU). \n \nThe preamble to the Annex also recommends that companies should not limit themselves \nto ad hoc climate reporting but rather should seek a better convergence of this type of \nreporting with existing financial and extra-financial information (thus incorporating the \nprovision already mentioned in Article 1 of the Directive). \n \n \n \n                                                           \n31 Action plan for sustainable Finance of the European C Commission, 8 march 2018: https://eur-\nlex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0097&from=FR  \n\n-49- \n \nMateriality in the annex to the guidelines dedicated to climate reporting \n \n \nOne of the new features introduced in the annex provided for by the Commission is the \nclarification it provides for a second definition of the concept of materiality – this can be \nconsidered in two ways, namely: \n \n(i) \nFinancial materiality (any factor that must be taken into account for \nunderstanding a company's development or performance); and/or  \n \n(ii) \nEnvironmental and social materiality (any factor that must be taken into \nconsideration for understanding a company's external impact). Thus, the annex \ndedicated to climate reporting should be used by companies when at least one of \nthese two perspectives is relevant. \n \nSource: European Commission consultation document (page 8) \"The double materiality perspective of the Non-\nFinancial Reporting Directive in the context of reporting climate-related information\" (February 2019) \n \nIn addition, the Commission specifies that materiality should be assessed in terms of risks \nas well as opportunities (with a view to redirecting investment flows towards the most \nvirtuous issuers, over and beyond a risk control mindset). This should not be \nunderestimated, as they can contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation. The \nCommission emphasises that climate change risks can result from the company's activity \nor from activities in its supply chain (upstream and downstream), but also from the \ncompany's dependence on natural capital. \nDifferentiation of the European Commission's recommendations on climate reporting \nThe Commission has therefore chosen to differentiate its recommendations depending on \nthe level of companies' exposure to the underlying issues: \n \ni. \nA first category (Type 1), including information that companies should consider \npublishing when it is necessary for a proper understanding of its development, \nperformance, position and the impact of its activities \n \n \n\n-50- \n \nii. \nA second category (Type 2), including other information that a company may \nconsider disclosing depending, among other factors, on the extent of the climate \nrisks and opportunities it has identified.32 \n  \nThe recommendations are thus divided into five categories, reflecting the five pillars on \nwhich the non-financial reporting directive is developed (business model, policies and due \ndiligence processes, outcomes, principal risks and their management, key performance \nindicators). The set represents a total of 40 new recommendations for the first four (i.e. \nbusiness model, policies and due diligence processes, outcomes, principal risks and their \nmanagement) and 12 key performance indicators (see Appendix 6). \n \nThe revised guidelines are scheduled to be published in June 2019. \n \n The creation at the end of 2018 of the \"European Corporate Reporting Lab\" as part \nof the EFRAG (European Financial Reporting Advisory Group)33 \n \nIts role is to stimulate innovations in the field of corporate reporting in the EU by \nfacilitating dialogue between companies, users and other relevant stakeholders. The Lab \nwill initially focus on extra-financial information and its practices, in line with the TCFD's \nrecommendations (remit of the first working group created in February 2019). \n \nOther themes along these lines include environmental accounting and, in the medium \nterm, integrated reporting, digitisation and innovations in the various other aspects of \ncorporate reporting. The Lab's steering committee consists of 17 members.34 It is chaired \nby the President of EFRAG35 and co-chaired by the Head of the relevant Commission \nDirectorate-General.36 The topics of the next working groups will be the subject of a \npublic consultation scheduled for June 2019. EFRAG's European Corporate Reporting \nLab is a forum for discussion on non-financial topics. It deals with the connection between \nthe development of extra-financial information and accounting standardisation (EFRAG's \nadvisory role as part of IFRS's accreditation, which is its primary activity). This forum \nmay make suggestions, under the supervision of its steering committee. \n \n \n                                                           \n32 It should be noted here that the European Commission has not to date provided further guidance on which \ncompanies may be affected by the Type 2 recommendations.   \n33 Non-profit organisation set up in 2001 whose role is to advise the European Commission on accounting \nmatters. \n34 Including Elisabeth Gambert (Afep), Sébastien Godinot (WWF Brussels), Arlene McCarthy (Bloomberg) and \nHilde Blomme (Accountancy Europe).  \n35 Jean-Paul Gauzès. \n36 Alain Deckers (DG FISMA, European Commission).  \n\n-51- \n \n1.4 Outside the European Union, a mixed panorama  \nThis section gives an overview of the various public initiatives outside the European Union, \nas well as casting light on regulatory changes in the US, Canada, Japan and China37. \nPublic initiatives  \nA large number of public initiatives have been launched outside the EU, especially since the \nearly 2000s:  \n The United Nations Global Compact, launched by Kofi Annan in 2000. France is a \nmember of its Government Group (and held the presidency in 2018)  \n \n The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, created in 1976, remain the most \ncomprehensive international framework for corporate social responsibility. Since 2011, \nthe OECD has published a series of sectoral guidance documents to assist companies and \nstakeholders in their implementation of the Guidelines (for example, the Due Diligence \nGuidance for Responsible Mineral Supply Chains was published in 2011, with a new \nedition in 2016; the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains \nwas published in 2016)  \n \n The Group of Friends of Paragraph 47 of the Rio+20 Declaration on sustainable \ndevelopment of June 2012, a group spearheaded by France, which has held the chair since \nits beginnings. The goal is to be a precursor in implementing extra-financial \nreporting public policy, as a means to measure the private sector’s contribution to \nsustainable development. In addition, the Group of Friends of Paragraph 47 has \ncommitted to strengthening extra-financial reporting in talks for the 2030 Agenda – in \nline with the SDG target 12.6 (i.e. “encourage companies, especially large and \ntransnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability \ninformation into their reporting cycle”)  \n \nFrom a regulatory standpoint, as explained in Section 1.3 above, public authorities have \nmainly intervened to legitimise and establish a minimal level of requirements – e.g. with \nthe guidelines on non-financial reporting (2017) or the guides published by Japan’s METI in \n2018 (see below) on sustainable development reporting.  \nThe Integrated P&L Alliance – involving the OECD, the European Commission and the \nWorld Bank – illustrates public authorities’ preference for relying on existing private-\nsector initiatives. Another characteristic is the participation of government authorities or \nstandard-setting organisations such as the IASB or the IOSCO, as well as boards of directors \nof organisations in charge of reporting frameworks such as the GRI, the SASB the IIRC (see \n1.4.1 below).  \n \n \n                                                           \n37 See Appendix 9 for further details on the regulatory frameworks for these countries. \n\n-52- \n \nRegulations outside the EU: some progress has been made, but still incomplete38 \nThe US regulatory framework is grounded in the concept of “materiality” and lacks \nambition due to political bargaining \nListed companies in the US refer chiefly to Regulation S-K, under the provisions of the \nSecurities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in order to provide relevant \ninformation about their business: description of the business (notably information about \ncompliance with US environmental regulations); description of any ongoing litigation that \ncould result in claims of more than 10% of total consolidated assets; description of risk factors \n(no specific reference to ESG risks); and the Management Discussion and Analysis – a report \naimed at providing the information needed to understand the company’s financial statements. \nAccording to the SEC’s interpretation issued in May 1989, the SEC considers Regulation S-K \nreporting to be mandatory whenever there is definite uncertainty that could have a material \neffect on a company’s financial statements.  \nIn February 2010, the SEC published its guidance on disclosure related to climate change \n(and its physical effects) and on legislative and regulatory developments regarding the fight \nagainst climate change and impact on the financial performance of listed companies.39 This \nreporting is an integral part of Regulation S-K reporting described above.  \nThe SEC’s document notes that in 2007, institutional investors had already submitted \npetitions to the SEC regarding the importance of specific climate change reporting. It also \nnotes that aside from certain sector-based rules (e.g. in the energy sector) of the SEC and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, a wide variety of NGOs require information (e.g. the \nClimate Registry) or issue frameworks (e.g. GRI, CDP) enabling listed companies to publish \nclimate-related information.  \n \nIt is worth emphasising that as early as the 1970s, the SEC published guidelines for listed \ncompanies to include the financial impact of compliance with environmental legislation in \ntheir reporting, based on the materiality of the information provided (SEC Release 33-5170, \n19 July 1971). In the 1970s and 1980s, the SEC worked on combining materiality \nrequirements better within the reporting framework laid out under Federal laws and \nregulations. In a 1976 case (TSC Industries v. Northway), the Supreme Court ruled: “the \nquestion of materiality, it is universally agreed, is an objective one, involving the significance \nof an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor […] A fact is material ‘if there is \na substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important’.” \n \nLastly, the Dodd Frank Act requires transparency from US listed companies on several \nkinds of information deemed material to investors’ choices in terms of social \nresponsibility, via its provisions related to conflict minerals (Section 1502), to coal mines \noperated by securities issuers (Section 1503), to payments made to foreign governments for \nresource extraction (Section 1504) and to the ratio or executive to employee compensation \n(Section 953(b)).  \nDespite advances on this topic in the US (financial impact of environmental rules in the \n1970s, publication of guidelines as of 2010, categories of climate-related risks, growing \ninvestor awareness since the 2000s), the fact that there is no definition of “sustainability” \nin US law and the lack of political ambition (no ESG focus in financial regulations or in US \n                                                           \n38 For more information on the countries mentioned in the report, see Appendix 9. \n39 https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2010/33-9106.pdf  \n\n-53- \n \ncompanies; positioning of the SEC and the US Treasury) have somewhat limited the extra-\nfinancial reporting of US companies.  \nCanada’s regulatory framework is recent, non-binding and focused on climate reporting \nIn Canada, accounting and financial regulatory authorities have been proactively tackling the \ntopic of extra-financial information since 2010. They ramped up their efforts in 2018 as part \nof a government-wide effort to foster sustainable finance.  \n \nAs such, the Canadian Securities Administrators (a group that brings together the financial \nmarket regulators for Canadian provinces in the aim of creating a harmonised Canadian \nsecurities regulatory framework) published: \n \n In 2010, recommendations regarding environmental reporting (for assessing climate risk, \nmonitoring and evaluating climate impacts), which requires forward-looking information  \n \n In 2011, recommendations on executive bodies’ management reports (without including \ndetails on the report content) \n \n In April 2018, a first series of recommendations on implementing the TCFD. Note that the \nMinistry of Environment and Climate Change and the Ministry of Finance created a panel \nof sustainable finance experts in 2018 to issue recommendations on the information to be \npublished about climate change, building on the TCFD’s recommendations. At this stage, \nthe consultation based on an interim report ended in late January and the final report is \ndue out in mid-2019.40 Moreover, the Canadian accounting profession is proactive in the \nfield of climate-related extra-financial information, and has published many reports on \nthis topic since 2008.  \n \nIn December 2018, Canada’s Accounting Standards Board published non-binding \nrecommendations on performance reporting. These recommendations are not limited to \nordinary financial information; they also focus on relevant extra-financial performance \nmetrics. These recommendations are nevertheless non-binding for companies and constitute \nmajor principles more than specific recommendations.  \n \nThus, the Canadian authorities – in collaboration with the private sector – have made \nsignificant headway on climate reporting, albeit without establishing binding requirements \nand by showing substantial hesitation to add additional obligations despite clear political \nsupport for the TCFD’s recommendations. In addition, extra-financial reporting on social \nissues is still underdeveloped in Canada.  \nJapan has gradual strengthened its extra-financial reporting, consistent with policymakers’ \ndetermination to enhance corporate governance \nThe advances made in Japan on extra-financial reporting are part of corporate governance \nreform, an integral part of the third focus area in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic \nstrategy. For a long time, Japan has lagged behind other developed economies in terms of \ncorporate governance, and its practices in this area are not yet in line with its high level of \neconomic development. Japan has reportedly now become No. 2 worldwide in terms of \nintegrated reporting by companies. \n                                                           \n40 \nhttps://www.canada.ca/fr/environnement-changement-climatique/services/changements-climatiques/groupe-\nexperts-financement-durable.html   \n\n-54- \n \nHence we note several public- and private-sector initiatives, including a code of conduct for \ninstitutional investors, published by the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) in 2014 \n(updated in May 2017). Nevertheless, the real turning point for extra-financial reporting in \nJapan came in June 2015 when a corporate governance code took effect. This code was \nsponsored by the JFSA and uses the OECD’s corporate governance principles and the \nprovisions of the Companies Act (amended in 2014).  \nThe corporate governance code requires that companies take appropriate measures to meet the \nchallenges of sustainable development. This includes social and environmental stakes \n(Principle 2.3). It also emphasises that these dimensions are an integral part of corporate risk \nmanagement, with careful oversight by the board of directors on these matters (to fulfil the \nboard members’ fiduciary duties).  \nPrinciple 3 of the corporate governance code specifies which disclosure principles are \napplicable to companies, including non-financial reporting: “This includes both financial \ninformation, such as financial standing and operating results, and non-financial information, \nsuch as business strategies and business issues, risks and governance.”  \nIn addition, in 2018, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) published its \nGuidance for Collaborative Value Creation to promote transparency by companies and to \nfoster dialogue between issuers and investors. This guidance gives strong emphasis to the \nconnection between sustainable growth, incorporating ESG issues, and capital allocation \nstrategy (i.e. measuring intangible capital). In December 2018,41 the METI published its \nGuidance on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, for the implementation of the TCFD \nrecommendations in Japan, following the final findings of a research group on the TCFD \nrecommendations (set up in August 2018). This guidance includes comments on the TCFD \nrecommendations, as well as sector-specific recommended disclosures (for the automobile, \niron and steel, chemicals, electrical and electronic, and energy sectors). In its guidance, the \nMETI specified that it would draft best practice guides for implementing the TCFD \nrecommendations but would not revise its guidance in the future.  \n \nSince 2015, Japanese authorities have clearly made efforts to strengthen the extra-financial \nreporting of Japanese companies, especially on climate matters (most reporting obligations \ninvolve climate), as part of the reform of corporate governance (in order to fuel a recovery in \nthe Japanese economy). Changes in regulatory requirements, combined with more widespread \nimplementation, are aimed at gradually making Japan a key country in extra-financial \nreporting. The Japanese authorities that we consulted with during our research have confirmed \nthat Japan is closely monitoring all international and European trends in extra-financial \nreporting. They wish to provide a framework for Japan’s multinationals that is consistent with \npractices elsewhere in the world. \nIn China, extra-financial reporting is fairly recent and is focused on the environmental \naspects, still lagging behind its trading partners and the rising expectations of investors \nSocial and environmental responsibility is a fairly new subject in China despite increasing \nsupport from the Chinese government. Extra-financial reporting was only introduced into \nChinese law in 2006, under the impetus of government-owned enterprises and the Shenzhen \nand Shanghai stock markets, with a provision requiring listed companies to publish an ESR \nreport and to disclose extra-financial information to investors. Thus, there are now a dozen \nlaws about ESR, including an important law on workplace safety that took effect in 2002. \n                                                           \n41 https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2018/pdf/1225_006b.pdf  \n\n-55- \n \nArticle 5 of the Chinese companies code stipulates: “in its operations, a company must \ncomply with laws and administrative rules, social ethics and business ethics. It must act in \ngood faith, accept government and public supervision, and bear the weight of its social \nresponsibilities.” \n \nThis growing obligation for extra-financial reporting has come hand in hand with more \nstringent environmental regulations, notably under pressure from civil society, due to the \nsignificant deterioration in the environment and demand for greater traceability in industrial \nproduction. For instance, a 2008 decree required the 31 local environmental agencies to \npublish information in the press on companies that were not complying with environmental \nstandards.  \n \nIn addition, a 2017 rule issued by China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) requires \nall listed Chinese companies and equity issuers set up extra-financial reporting by 2020. This \nstricter regulatory framework is backed by stronger shareholder engagement in Chinese \ncompanies (within the limits of local governance rules and the proportion of foreign investors \nin the share capital of local companies) and growing pressure from investors in China, notably \ndue to the ramp-up of green bond issues.  \n \nExtra-financial reporting in China has developed recently, especially on environmental issues, \nbut it is still well behind other that of other countries. Increasingly stringent requirements \nfrom financial regulators are nevertheless likely to drive extra-financial reporting trends and \nmeet the expectations of Chinese society and of foreign investors.  \n\n-56- \n \n1.5 Private-sector standards are flourishing and ambitious \nOur task force noted that extra-financial disclosure standards are currently mainly \ndriven by the private sector. This observation calls for two general introductory remarks: \n \n The distinction between private and public initiatives is obviously influenced by the \nconstitutional, institutional and legislative circumstances. Within the EU, any initiative \nthat does not originate in a decision made in compliance with the EU’s institutional rules \nis automatically deemed to be “private”. This classification in no way means that such \ninitiatives are not worthwhile or influential, but it ranks them within the hierarchy of \nnorms derived from Roman law. We can note, in passing, the need to avoid the frequent \nmisunderstandings between the legal culture referred to above and other traditions that \ngive more importance to the mainstreaming of best practices when it comes to the \nemergence of law and related regulations. \n \n In all cases, law and its practical applications interact in such a way that – quite \nfortunately – the line between the two is permeable. For example, the guidelines \nestablished by the EU to apply the Directive allow room for private initiatives (which are \nexplicitly referred to in the Directive) without automatically consecrating such initiatives. \nAnd conversely, private-sector initiatives endeavour to situate themselves within the \nframework of any existing public initiatives. \n \nIn this report, we apply the conventional approach of using the terms “private-sector norms” \nor “private-sector standards” to refer to standards established by private-sector initiatives, and \nwe reserve the term “standards” for norms or standards that are established or approved as \npart of a public-sector institutional process. \nThe task force has identified multiple initiatives which can be summarised as follows:  \ni. \nGeneral scope initiatives, promoting global objectives, offering global frameworks \nand general principles, including in some cases management principles \nii. \nInitiatives on the content of information, dealing with environmental, social and \ngovernance issues \niii. \nTopical initiatives related to a specific issue (such as climate change) \niv. \nInitiatives aiming at integration of the extra-financial data within the financial \naccounting.  \n \n \n\n-57- \n \nNature of the initiatives \nInitiatives’ names \nGeneral scope initiatives \n SDGs and Global Compact of United \nnations \n ISO 26000 \n International \nIntegrated \nReporting \nCouncil (IIRC) \n “Core and More” initiative \nInitiatives \non \ncontent \nrelated \nto \nenvironmental, social and governance \nissues  \n Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \n Sustainability \nAccounting \nStandards \nBoard (SASB) \nTopical initiatives on: \n Intangibles \n \n Climate issues \n \n \n Other issues \n \n WICI \n \n Carbon Disclosure project (CDP) \n CDSB \n Task-Force on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) \n \n Natural Capital Coalition \n WBCSD \nInitiatives aiming at accounting of extra-\nfinancial information \n CARE model \n The “universal accounting” model \n \nAfter a short description of the abovementioned initiatives, the report will present an analysis \nof the three main actors (i.e. GRI, SASB and IIRC) and a presentation of the current status of \nthe international accounting standards setters. The content of the initiatives will be further \ndetailed in Chapter 2.  \n \nGeneral scope initiatives, promoting global objectives, offering global frameworks and \ngeneral principles, including in some cases management principles  \n SDGs and Global Compact of the United nations \n \nIn September 2015, the member states of the United Nations adopted a 15-year \nprogramme: the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. This followed on the heels \nof the Millennium Development Goals. This ambitious agenda of 17 global goals is a \nframework for tackling inequality, exclusion and injustice, addressing the issue of climate \nchange and the erosion of biodiversity, and ending extreme poverty. All stakeholders – \nnamely governments, citizens, non-profits, the private sector, and public institutions and \nentities – are called on to help achieve these goals. \n\n-58- \n \nPrivate-sector companies, via the Global Compact, are active stakeholders with a key role \nto play in making Agenda 2030 a success. The ESR strategies that have already been \nimplemented within their organisations are therefore often defined as their contribution to \nsustainable development and are therefore the central focus for SDG monitoring. \nWorks are under way to bring the private-sector standards of GRI and SASB more in line \nwith the TCFD conclusions and recommendations (see Section 2.3). \n \n ISO 26000 “Guidance on social responsibility”  \n \nISO 26000 is a voluntary international standard aimed at defining the concept of social \nresponsibility. It endeavours to give organisations guidelines and to describe the principles \nand themes of social responsibility. As such, it is a common international resource for \nanyone wishing to build legitimacy in terms of social responsibility.  \nThe process breaks down into seven key core subjects: organisational governance, human \nrights, labour practices, environment, fair operating practices, consumer issues, and \ncommunity involvement and development. These subjects help the organisation identify \nthe relevant fields and actions to be implemented.  \nISO 26000 was published in 2010 and has not been updated since then. Certain issuers \nhave referred to it as their benchmark (34% of issuers according to the Afep/Medef survey \ncarried out as part of the task force). \nGiven its age and its characteristics, the people interviewed by the task force did not make \nmany comments about ISO 26000. \n \n The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) \nIn 2013, the IIRC published its International <IR> (integrated reporting) Framework.42 \nIntegrated reporting is an approach aimed at stating concisely how an organisation’s \nstrategy, governance, performance and outlook result in short-, medium- and long-term \nvalue creation given its environment.  \nThis approach fosters coherent information for equity providers and financial investors. \nThe integrated report is an “umbrella” report designed to encompass all the other reports \npublished by a company (financial and non-financial alike) in order to give investors a \ncomprehensive, coherent and overarching view. \nCompanies are analysed in terms of six kinds of capital: financial, manufactured, \nintellectual, human, social and relationship, and natural. Mentioning these six capitals is \nrecommended but remains optional as the corporate entity may select the ones that are \nsignificant having regard to its activity.   \nIn addition to this breakdown around six kinds of capital, the framework gives guidelines \nfor drafting an integrated report: presenting strategic priorities and future orientations, \nconnectivity of information, stakeholder relations, selectiveness, concision, reliability and \n                                                           \n42 http://integratedreporting.org/resource/international-ir-framework/ \n\n-59- \n \ncompleteness of information, coherence and comparability of data. Thus, the IIRC \nframework is a behavioural standard, not a prescriptive metrics-based one. \nThe task force met with representatives of the IIRC. The ensuing discussions were very \nopen, and the IIRC stated that the framework is indeed intended as a “host structure” for \nvarious kinds of corporate financial and non-financial communication, which can refer to \ndifferent content frameworks. It is also designed as a way to organise an approach based \non the two key concepts of integrated thinking and integrated reporting. As such, the \nframework does not contain standards per se, but rather a methodological and behavioural \nframework. The approach is based on the idea that companies with “integrated” \nmanagement will ultimately outperform. This approach is focused primarily on investors, \nbut as it is open-ended, it can take other stakeholders into account. The IIRC’s ambition is \nto roll the framework out globally. \nThe task force met with users, analysts and many observers who shared their generally \npositive opinion on the IIRC. Its very open, pragmatic and forward-thinking approach \nmeans that it can be tailored to each company’s needs and implemented over time. \nBasically, it is fairly easy to claim to follow the general spirit of the IIRC framework, \neven though a closer look reveals a high level of underlying requirements. \n Accountancy Europe’s Core & More initiative \nAccountancy Europe (formerly the Federation of European Accountants) published a \ndocument in September 2017 for discussions about corporate reporting: “Core & More: an \nopportunity for smarter corporate reporting”. 43 The aim is to think solely about how the \ninformation published by companies is presented. In this approach, there are no \nindications on how to prepare the contents of the information, the metrics or the \nframeworks to be used.  \nFaced with the increasing needs for information from multiple stakeholders, the diverse \nrange of information published (financial and non-financial), the links between \ninformation and the need for a structured message, Accountancy Europe proposes a new \nreporting presentation concept. It is twofold: 1) The “core” part is a central module \nincluding the essential and broad information about the company’s business. This core is \nuseful for all stakeholders. 2) The “more” section contains specific modules with details \non certain topics, so that interested stakeholders can gather only the information that is \nuseful to them. \nGenerali adopted this principle in its integrated report, which it has published since \n2017.44 The task force did not receive many comments about this initiative, which appears \nto be based on principles and encouragement but whose practical scope should give rise to \nadditional developments. \n \n \n                                                           \n43 https://www.accountancyeurope.eu/publications/core-more-smarter-corporate-reporting/ \n44 Group annual integrated report 2018, page 4 - https://www.generali.com/investors/reports-and-presentations: \n“The group reporting approach is based on the integrated thinking and Core&More concept.”  \n\n-60- \n \nInitiatives on content related to environmental, social and governance issues \n \n The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \n \nGRI is an NGO founded in 1997 by CERES (Coalition for Environmentally Responsible \nEconomies) and UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme). Its goal was to \ndevelop a framework for high-quality “sustainability” reporting. \nAfter developing several versions of recommendations (the first version, G1, was in \n2002), based on multi-party working groups until G4 in 2013, GRI started a codification \nand ranking process, leading it to put forward a more general framework with the \npublication of “private standards” in 2016. \nConcurrently, GRI stated that it was a standard-setter and updated its governance, as \ndescribed below. \nThe GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards and subsequent metrics are aimed at \nproviding a fairly comprehensive framework for communicating on the economic, \nenvironmental and social impacts of a company, and thus to meet the ESR reporting needs \nof various stakeholders (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2 for a detailed analysis of contents). \nThe task force met with GRI representatives. The ensuing discussions were very open, and \nGRI indicated that its standards are well recognised worldwide, and it is eager for this \nrecognition to receive official government backing so that these standards can act as a \nglobal benchmark. \nIn addition, the task force met with users, analysts and many observers who shared their \nmixed opinions on GRI. They all recognised the pioneering, ground-breaking and \nworthwhile nature of GRI’s approach. Some interviewees acknowledged that the GRI \nstandards have genuine merit as a benchmark for high-quality extra-financial information. \nOthers regretted a lack of actual innovative value-added and a lack of ambition in the past \nfew years, and viewed the insufficient sector-by-sector approach to be a major weakness. \nLastly, many stated that GRI’s governance reform (analysed below) does not necessarily \nfulfil expectations in that regard, despite general praise for GRI’s current executives. \n \n The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) \n \nSASB is a US-based non-profit created in 2011. It describes itself as a standard-setter. \nOn 7 November 2018, SASB published a set of industry-specific “private-sector \nstandards” for sustainable development. These standards cover financially-material issues \nin 77 different sectors across the economy. \nThis publication followed on the release of a conceptual framework (published in 2013, \nthen in 2016) that described the principles used to draft the standards. \nThese standards are aimed at giving financial investors and equity providers detailed \ninformation for each sector on the risks and opportunities of a company’s operations due \nto social and environmental dimensions. Working groups comprised of sector specialists \ndefined a deliberately small number of relevant metrics based on sector expertise and data \n\n-61- \n \ngenerally used on the market (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2 for a detailed analysis of the \ncontents). \nThe SASB’s definition of “sustainability” corresponds to the social and environmental \nresponsibility of companies although governance-related aspects are not specifically \ncovered by these standards. \nThe task force met with SASB representatives who, in a very open discussion, stated that \nthe most recent publication of standards and sector indicators was, in their view, a key \nstep towards a straightforward, pragmatic approach that would drive action by companies, \ndata aggregators and investors. They expressed their strong determination to work towards \na global rollout of these industry-specific standards. \nThe task force also met with users, analysts and many observers. Their opinions of the \nSASB standards were also mixed. Many interviewees recognised the value and appeal of \nthe industry-specific approach. However, many also noted the lack of a common \nfoundation and the oversimplified nature of certain metrics due to the deliberately small \nnumber of metrics and a US-centric approach. For many interviewees, the SASB \ngovernance structure (analysed below) is not suitable for a global rollout irrespective of \nthe expertise of SASB’s current executives. \n \nTopical initiatives \n Intangibles: WICI Network \n \nThe WICI Network was created in October 2007 under the leadership of the Enhanced \nBusiness Reporting Consortium in the US,45 the EFFAS (European Federation of \nFinancial Analysts Societies),46 and Japan’s METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and \nIndustry).47 This network’s sole focus is on improving the reporting of intangibles. \n \nIts aim is to develop: 1) a voluntary reporting framework that explains why intangible \nassets can generate value; 2) recommendations for setting up and monitoring sector \nmetrics; and 3) an XBRL taxonomy. \n \nDespite its clear conceptual appeal, this approach did not spark many comments from the \npeople interviewed by the task force. This situation may be due to the priority given to \nanalysing risk factors and the resources available for the WICI initiative. \n \nClimate-focused initiatives are the current issue. The growing collective awareness, over \nthe past 20 years, of the climate emergency has sparked many reporting initiatives on this \ntopic. Notably: \n                                                           \n45 A consortium created by the AICPA (American Institute of CPAs): “The Enhanced Business Reporting \nConsortium (EBRC) is a collaborative, market-driven initiative that provides an opportunity for users and \nproviders of capital to work together for the public interest to improve the quality of information provided to \ncapital markets. The Consortium will work to promote greater transparency by developing an internationally \nrecognized, voluntary framework for presentation and disclosure of value drivers, non-financial performance \nmeasures and qualitative information.” \n46 Headed up by Ferrara University. \n47 Headed up by Waseda University. \n\n-62- \n \n The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) \n \nCDP is an NGO created in 2000 that is fighting for transparent environmental information \nby economic and administrative stakeholders. Since 2003, CDP has been running an \nannual campaign, based on a questionnaire, to gather information about companies’ \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Since 2010, this survey has included the oil & gas sector. \nAlso in 2010, CDP expanded its scope by launching annual surveys on water management \n(“CDP Water”) and in 2013, an additional survey on forest management (“CDP Forests”). \nUntil 2016, its assessment method was based on the Climate Disclosure Score and the \nClimate Performance Band. The data collected is fed into a database, which has now \nbecome a benchmark in terms of carbon emissions data. \n \n The CDSB  \n \nThe Carbon Disclosure Standard Board (CDSB) was founded in 2007 under the impetus \nof the World Economic Forum. The CDSB proposes a framework for reporting \nenvironmental and climate information that places equal emphasis on financial capital and \nnatural capital. \n \n The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \n  \nThe TCFD48 is a working group set up in late 2015 during the COP21 by the G20 Financial \nStability Board. Its goal is to foster transparency in climate-related financial information. \nIn 2017, the TCFD issued its recommendations for climate reporting. \nThe European Commission is currently in a consultation process aimed at incorporating \nthese recommendations into its own recommendations following on from the Non-\nFinancial Reporting Directive. \n \nThe other specific initiatives deal with natural capital (including biodiversity issues) and \nhuman capital. \n \n The Natural Capital Coalition \n \nThe Natural Capital Coalition was created in 2012 by 14 international organisations \nrepresenting all types of stakeholders. Its purpose is to promote integrated thinking about \nall kinds of natural capital49 in decision-making processes.  \nThis coalition published a Natural Capital Protocol in 2016 and updated it in 2018.  The \ngoal of this protocol is to provide a framework for company executives to obtain reliable, \ncredible and actionable information on protecting natural capital. \nThe aim is not to create new standards, but to build on existing methods50 and create \nmore standardised approaches focused on action and implementation issues. This \n                                                           \n48 https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/  \n49 “Natural capital is another term for the stock of renewable and non-renewable natural resources (e.g. plants, \nanimals, air, water, soils, and minerals) that combine to yield a flow of benefits to people.” \n50 See “The path towards the natural capital protocol: a primer for business” (diagram on p. 11). \n\n-63- \n \napproach is the foundation for the EP&L (environmental profit & loss) statement \npublished by certain groups (such as Kering, BASF and Philips; see Section 1.6).  \n \n The WBCSD  \n \nThe World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is an association of \nthe largest multinational firms whose purpose is to share experiences and achievements in \nthe field of sustainable development via thematic working groups.  \nWBCSD aims to take part in development policy, boosting companies’ contribution to \nsustainable progress, promoting sustainable development in the working world, and \nhelping countries build a sustainable future. \nIn 2017, the WBCSD published its “Social & Human Capital protocol”,51 which includes \ndefinitions, guidelines and a reporting framework for social aspects. \nThe task force met with users, analysts and many observers who shared their generally \npositive opinions on the existing climate reporting frameworks, notably because they have a \nlonger track record (meaning that the related metrics have already been developed). The \nprinciples and metrics included in the standards are deemed fairly robust (alongside the \nTCFD, the CDSB and the CDP). However, the task force noted difficulties related to the \nspecific reporting for various emissions “scopes” in particular. With regard to the reference \nframeworks focused more broadly on environmental issues, following its analysis and \ndiscussions, the task force noted that the organisational and methodological aspects need to be \nstrengthened. This is the aim of numerous ongoing initiatives, e.g. at the OECD.  \nAll these initiatives are mentioned in the guidelines subsequent to the Directive on Non-\nFinancial Reporting. These guidelines were published by the Commission in 2017 (see \nAppendices 2 and 4), and the very governance structure of some of these initiatives is \nreviewed later on in this report. Meanwhile, the specific proposals are analysed in greater \ndetail in Chapter 2 (reference framework content) and Chapter 3 (reporting structures). \nMoreover, there are less well-known initiatives aimed at incorporating extra-financial \nfactors into accounting. The task force discussed this topic with the promoters of two such \npara-accounting initiatives: \n \nThe CARE model (“Comprehensive Accounting in Respect of Ecology ”)52 \n \nThis model, developed since 2015, aims to incorporate accounting and environmental \nissues directly into accounting standards and to include them on companies’ balance \nsheets and P&L statements. Similar to financial capital, the aim is to build a model that \npreserves and maintains natural and human capital, as well. This proposal is currently \nbeing experimented in France with support from ADEME in the “Farms of the Future” \nproject. \nBeginning with the observation that apparently free resources actually entail hidden \ncollective costs, this model adds natural or social “capital” to assets and liabilities, then \nmonitors it over time by accounting for costs associated with maintaining and developing \nthis non-financial capital. \n \n                                                           \n51 https://docs.wbcsd.org/2019/02/Social_and_Human_Capital_Protocol.pdf  \n52 Researchers Jacques Richard and Alexandre Rambaud developed this model in 2015. \n\n-64- \n \n \nThe “universal accounting” model \n \nThe “universal accounting” model53 assesses the monetary value of an organisation’s \nESR actions by relying on stakeholders to determine the most relevant criteria for \ndefining and steering an action. \n− The aim then is to quantify these metrics and assign a monetary value to them. This \nvalue will be included in the P&L statements so that the results of the action are \nvisible. This approach has been developed since 2007. McDonald’s France \nexperimented with it for a few years. \nThese models are experimental and enjoy support from certain individuals contacted by the \ntask force. Some of our contacts stated that these models make the interesting but challenging \nwager of translating into monetary terms certain concepts that currently “do not have a price” \ndue to the lack of legal obligations (see Section 1.1 above) and inserting them into traditional \naccounting frameworks. Thus, setting conventions for determining the valuations is crucial, \nand there is not yet consensus on this point. The mixture of data types (monetary and non-\nmonetary) allows for an interesting overview, in theory, of performance for all factors. \nHowever, this mixture also raises the risk of being perceived as unreliable as it translates non-\nfinancial factors into monetary terms based on conventions.  \n \nNGO-type governance structures with ambitions for setting global standards: the \nexample of three standard-setters with a general focus, GRI, SASB and IIRC \n“At the SASB, our work sits at the intersection of two extraordinary market forces – \ncompanies, and their investors. We enable the supply side – the companies – to better meet \nincreasing investor demand for material, decision-useful data on sustainability performance \n[…] The SASB standards may challenge legacy thinking and bust some myths, but I hope we \ncan convince all of you that they are also a natural evolution of modern finance. Whether \nyou’re a multi-billion dollar pension fund or kid in South America relying on your mom for \nfinancial advice, ESG is not a separate wedge in the colour-coded pie chart of asset \nallocation. Material ESG risks – and opportunities – are embedded in all asset classes. It’s \nthe whole pie. To understand and manage exposure to risk, you need good data on material \nfactors. You need the SASB. It’s as simple as that.” \nSource: SASB Symposium Speech, Dr Jean Rogers, founder and former chairwoman of the SASB, 30 \nNovember 2017 \n“The practice of disclosing sustainability information leads to increased transparency […] As \nthe pioneer of sustainability reporting, I can safely say that GRI has been right at the helm, \nleading this effort of increasing corporate transparency. GRI has also evolved its reporting \nframework over the years, corresponding with how our collective understanding of \nsustainability issues has evolved. For example, our interpretation of sustainability has \nexpanded to include several topics that affect the long-term viability of the socio-economic \nfabric of our world – topics such as human rights and anti-corruption, to name a few. During \nthis period, leading companies have also evolved to hold themselves accountable for an ever-\nwider range of impacts. The sustainability reporting process initially began with in-depth \nreporting about impacts within the four walls of the business, but it has progressively \nexpanded to include impacts outside of the business, such as within value chains, among \n                                                           \n53 https://www.cabinetdesaintfront.fr/la-comptabilite-universelle  \n\n-65- \n \nconsumers and within communities affected by business operations. GRI has played an \nindispensable role in this evolution.” \nSource: Q&A with GRI Chief Executive Tim Mohin, 4 October 2017. \n \nAs these quotes illustrate, the organisations that are backing existing frameworks currently \nassert an international ambition. Their influence with companies and investors is partially \nattributable to the fact that they come from the private sector, which probably enables them to \nunderstand users’ needs and constraints more easily. GRI and SASB define themselves as \n“standard-setters”, just like standard-setters driven by public-sector initiatives or officially \nrecognised by the authorities, such as the IASB or the Basel Committee. In this environment, \nIIRC considers itself more as a think-tank.  \nAlmost all the reporting frameworks described above are therefore characterised by their \nprivate-sector origins and the major role of committed, motivated and influential stakeholders \n(including foundations focused on these topics, such as Bloomberg, as well as large \ncompanies and major audit/consulting firms) in their governance structures, their promotional \nefforts and their development.  \nTheir governance is also concentrated inasmuch as the processes for appointments and for \nsupervision are similar to those of a “club” of individuals from various backgrounds who \nnevertheless share the same convictions and determination to take action. \n GRI’s board of directors is chaired by an American with nearly 25 years’ experience in a \nUK/US network of international consultants.  \n \n− GRI is an NGO, with a multi-party and circular governance. Since its governance \nstructure was revamped in 2014, it has had a board of directors, which advises the \nGlobal Sustainability Standards Board, created in 2014 and whose members are \nappointed by the Independent Appointments Committee. The latter committee is \nstrictly separate from the committee that appoints members to the board of directors. \nNote that the 15 members of the board of directors are appointed by the GRI \nNominating Committee for four-year terms. A Due Process Oversight Committee \nincludes representatives of companies, employees, investors and civil society; its \nmembers are also appointed by the Independent Appointments Committee. The Due \nProcess Oversight Committee reviews and supervises the work by the Global \nSustainability Standards Board. The Stakeholder Council gathers nearly fifty members \nand is the formal stakeholder forum within the GRI governance structure and advises \nthe Board on strategic issues. Its key functions include appointing Board members and \nmaking recommendations on future policy, business planning and activity.  \n \n \n\n-66- \n \n \n \nSource: Global Reporting Initiative website (24 April 2019) \n \n− GRI’s financing comes from corporate foundations and government entities (one-third \nof total funding). The “Big 4” make a relatively small contribution (Deloitte and \nKPMG each gave €100,000 in 2017). The largest contributors are the Swiss State \nSecretariat for Economic Affairs, the Swedish International Development Cooperation \nAgency; the UK Department for International Development; the World Council for \nSustainable Development; the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Australian \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade). Two-thirds of funding comes from its \nreporting and training services, as well as members’ dues. \n− GRI’s operating budget for 2017 was around €12m (source: 2016-17 annual report).  \n \n The SASB was founded by Jean Rogers, an American citizen and former consultant from \nan international consultant network.  \n \n− Its board of directors is chaired by Robert Steel, who was previously deputy mayor in \nthe administration of New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. It is co-chaired by \nMary Schapiro, a former chairperson of the SEC and the CFTC, who has also served \nas Michael Bloomberg’s special adviser since October 2018.  \n− Its board members include members of the international networks of auditing firms, as \nwell as one of the founders of Bloomberg Financial Markets. \n− The SASB is a foundation including a board of directors for the SASB Foundation and \na Standards Board. The board of directors appoints members to the Standards Board, \nwhereas the Standards Board supervises and can appeal decisions by the board of \ndirectors. \n− The largest contributors to the SASB (whose total contribution in 2016-17 was more \nthan $2m) are Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Big 4 and a few foundations (including \nthe Rockefeller Foundation).  \n− The SASB’s operating budget was around $7m in 2017 (source: 2017 annual report).  \n\n-67- \n \nSource: SASB website (24 April 2019) \n \n The IIRC is an NGO whose governance structure comprises a board of directors and a \nCouncil. The Council appoints members of the Governance and Nominations Committee, \nwhich in turn appoints the board members. \n \n− The board is chaired by Barry Melancon, CEO of the Association of International \nCertified Professional Accountants (AICPA-CIMA). Only a few board members are \nfrom the accounting profession (ACCA, PwC). The Council is chaired by Dominic \nBarton, a former McKinsey general manager, and includes nearly 80 members whose \nrole is to contribute to collective and multi-stakeholder discussions of the future of \nintegrated reporting. It includes representatives of the Big 4, of the accounting and \naudit professions (including IFAC and DIPAC), of the financial services industry and \nof companies, the CFA Institute, as well as the CEOs of GRI (Tim Mohin), CDSB \n(Richard Samans) and Steven Gunders (SASB), IOSCO, IASB, World Bankand a few \nNGOs (including Transparency International).  \n− Amongst the members of the board, Council and the Governance and Nominations \nCommittee, members come from very diverse backgrounds (much more so than for \nGRI and the SASB).  \n\n-68- \n \n \nSource: IIRC website (24 April 2019) \n \n− With regard to the IIRC’s financing, nearly half comes from companies (“business and \nother reporter entities”), a third from the accounting profession (AICPA-CIMA; \nACCA; Deloitte; EY; PwC; KPMG; Global Accounting Alliance; International \nFederation of Accountants; etc.), and the remaining quarter comes from civil society, \npublic funds and stock market platforms. \n− The IIRC’s operating budget for 2017 came to around £1.7m (source: 2017 financial \nstatements). \n \nNote also that the SASB and the IIRC benefit from staff from the Big 4 or other corporations \non secondment, or even pro bon research by these firms: \n At the SASB, these contributions in kind were valued at around $560,000 in 2017 (source: \n2017 annual report).  \n For the IIRC, staff on secondment accounted for 30% of total staff in 2017.  \nInternational accounting standard-setters: in the role of outside observers \nAccording to their mission statement, the scope of application for the works of the \ninternational accounting standard-setters (IASB and FASB) is solely financial: \n \nThe IFRS Foundation is a not-for-profit, public interest organisation established to \ndevelop a single set of high-quality, understandable, enforceable and globally \naccepted accounting standards – IFRS Standards – and to promote and facilitate their \nadoption.54 \nThe collective mission of the FASB, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board \n(GASB) and the FAF is to establish and improve financial accounting and reporting \nstandards to provide useful information to investors and other users of financial \nreports and to educate stakeholders on how to most effectively understand and \nimplement those standards.55 \nThe question of the boundaries between accounting and financial information arises \nfrequently, notably with regard to defining intangible assets, and the content of the \n                                                           \n54 IFRS Foundation annual report \n55 https://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/SectionPage&cid=1176154526495  \n\n-69- \n \nManagement \ncommentary \nmanagement commentary. The scope of corporate reporting can be represented schematically \nas follows:56 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2010, the IASB published an initial “practice statement” on the potential content of the \nmanagement commentary. The IASB’s ambition was to provide a reference framework for the \ncountries that have adopted IFRS. The management commentary, according to the practice \nstatement, aims to provide integrated information on the context that could be useful to better \nunderstand financial information: retrospective views (positive and negative impacts) and \nprospective items on potential impacts on future financial performance. The document is \nstructured in five main sections57, which is an interesting point. Thus, it is a first step towards \nnon-financial disclosure. The practice statement’s approach is different from the one followed \nby the Chapter 5 “management report” of the European Directive: content (less compared to \nthe practice statement); non-financial statement (not covered by the practice statement) and \ngovernance statement (partially included by the practice statement). \nThe practice statement is currently being revised, notably to include recent developments on \nthe need for climate-related information following the TCFD talks.  \nThe task force understand that this update will detail the content of the document based on the \n2010 approach. No new concept is expected. Hans Hoogervorst, chairman of the IASB, \nrepeated this on 2 April during a speech at a conference at Cambridge University:58 “I do not \nthink the IASB is equipped to enter the field of sustainability reporting directly.” \nNevertheless, the IASB is monitoring this topic within the Corporate Reporting Dialogue (see \nChapter 2). \nWith regard to the FASB, the topic of extra-financial information does not clearly seem to be \na concern for the SEC or to be part of the FASB’s mandate. The members of the FASB board \ndid not wish to express an opinion on this topic. \nIn addition, this issue was debated in late 2018 at Oxford University following the publication \nof a green paper by the academics Richard Barker and Robert G. Eccles.59 The title of the \npaper was: “Should FASB and IASB be responsible for setting standards for non-financial \ninformation?” It gave rise to a debate at Oxford on 12 December 2018.60 \n                                                           \n56 Based on the IASB’s presentation for its “management commentary” project \n57 See paragraph 24 “Elements of management commentary” : the nature of business; management’s objectives \nand its strategies for meeting those objectives; the entity’s most significant resources, risks and relationship \n(3R) , the results of operations and prospects and the critical performance measures and indicators that \nmanagement uses to evaluate the entity’s performance against stated objectives. \n58 https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/2019/04/speech-iasb-chair-on-sustainability-reporting/  \n59 Oxford University and Said Business School \n60 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyzkKFgp6NU  \nFinancial \nreporting/ \nfinancial \nstatements \nExtended \nreporting/ \nESR and \nother non-\nfinancial \ndisclosures \n\n-70- \n \nThis paper noted the growing need for non-financial information, often with an ESR bent, \nalong with the proliferation of “standard-setters” in the field. As these stakeholders are chiefly \nNGOs, lacking sound financial backing, the sustainability of their actions is, in the authors’ \nview, a serious cause for concern. Hence the two academics decided to research their paper \nwith the idea in mind of placing non-financial standards and sustainable development issues \nin the hands of established institutions that are recognised in the field of accounting standards.  \nOur task force noted the following pro/con arguments: \nPros \nIn favour of including non-financial \ninformation in accounting standards \nCons \nAgainst including non-financial information \nin accounting standards \nInvestors and financial users need non-\nfinancial information  \nInvestors are not the only stakeholders. How \ncan information be explained to other \nstakeholders? \nThese frameworks need to be included, and \nthe IASB/FASB would have the credibility \nand the methodology to do so \nThe IASB/FASB lack ESR expertise  \nNeed for comparable information \nComparability is more relevant within \nbusiness sectors \nNeed for standardisation rather than the \ncurrent proliferation of abundant, diverse and \nhard-to-understand information \nStandardisation is a complex process given \nthe wide breadth of topics. The crucial \ninformation has not yet been defined. Need \nto define what is meant by “non-financial \ninformation” \n \nFollowing these debates, the audience was divided on the topic (half of the audience was in \nfavour of an inclusion in the accounting standard setting, half against). This debate continues \nin 2019 and should ultimately lead to a white paper being published by year end. At this stage, \ninternational accounting standard-setters are clearly standing as observers on the side-lines \nwith regard to extra-financial reporting. \nThe private sector plays a crucial role in designing extra-financial reporting \nframeworks, but this nevertheless requires dialogue with public authorities to avoid the \nsubsequent risk of “endogamy”. \n \n \n\n-71- \n \n1.6 Innovative companies and NGO scrutiny: a few examples \nOver the past few years, private-sector players have been the driving force in drafting extra-\nfinancial reporting frameworks, and more broadly, in credentialing the social and environment \ncommitments and performance of companies. The involvement of public authorities has \nmainly focused on supporting private-sector initiatives and, to a certain extent, lending \nlegitimacy to extra-financial reporting approaches. Meanwhile, NGOs are exerting more \npressure and scrutiny on the quality of companies’ extra-financial reporting.  \nOther private-sector initiatives for developing extra-financial information have been \nlaunched, but these are more in the joint planning stages rather than leading to a \nsignificant change in practices \nWe note a series of private-sector initiatives, including the following ones which stand out \nthanks to their level of acceptance and ambition in terms of extra-financial reporting: \n Accounting for Sustainability (A4S),61 created under the aegis of the Prince of Wales in \n2004, initiated discussions to ensure that financiers take the shift to sustainable \ndevelopment and start thinking about the risks and opportunities associated with \nenvironmental and social issues. A4S has also been involved in the creation of IICBA and \nparticipates in many international initiatives such as the Natural Capital Coalition and the \nCommonwealth Climate & Law Initiative. \n \n In France, EpE, the French Association of Companies for the Environment, created in \n1992, brings together around 40 major French and international companies from all \neconomic sectors and represents French stakeholders within the WBCSD. These \ncompanies wish to better incorporate the environment into their strategic decisions and \ndaily management. Thus, EpE has published a series of reports and recommendations on \nclimate reporting and corporate climate strategy (since 2015), managing the biodiversity \nimpacts on the value chain (2016), and measuring and managing water resources (2015) \nas well as a report exploring the feasibility of carbon neutrality by companies by 2050 \n(May 2019). \n \n The “Reporting 3.0” platform was launched in 2012 by Ralph Thurm (a German whose \nwork experience includes stints at Deloitte and GRI). It notable includes companies, as \nwell as big 4 audit firms.  \n \nThis platform is based on the conviction that corporate reporting has a major influence on \neconomic trends. With this in mind, the platform has developed four “blueprints” for a \n“green and inclusive” economy. One of these blueprints relates to reporting: “Reporting \nfor a Green, Inclusive and Open Regenerative Economy”. According to the platform’s \nphilosophy, reporting should be defined and should evolve in close connection with the \nother three blueprints, so that the entire approach resembles an ecosystem: “Accounting \nfor Future Fit Reporting”, aimed at including the net impact of positive/negative \nexternalities; “Data Integration, Contextualisation and Activation for Multicapital \nAccounting”, integrating data and leveraging them for multi-capital accounting; and \n“Information and Reporting Demands for New Business Models”, i.e. adapting reporting \nand accounting to emerging business models.  \n                                                           \n61 https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/initiatives \n\n-72- \n \n \nThis initiative belongs to an integrated reporting perspective, along the lines of \ndiscussions about GDP alternatives (e.g. the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission) and the \n2012 Rio+20 agenda, as well as all the work aimed at updating corporate reporting (GRI, \nIIRC, TCFD, SASB, Natural Capital Coalition, UNEP Inquiry) – and more broadly aimed \nat achieving the SDGs.  \n \nNevertheless, the overall structure remains complex, at the border between \nreporting, management and corporate organisation – ultimately converging with the \ncreation of a “Future Fit Business Benchmark” that connects the global challenges \n(namely, destabilisation of ecosystems, climate change, loss of biodiversity, and \nenergy/food/health crises, etc.) and benefits for companies (success in a circular economy, \nimproved staff productivity, reduced exposure to fossil fuels, avoiding reputational and \nfinancial costs due to regulatory changes, etc.).  \n \n Social Accountability International, a US-based NGO founded in 1997 and grouping \ntogether representatives of large companies worldwide (for instance, its board of directors \nis chaired by the former chairman of the Gap Foundation), whose task is to promote \nworkers’ fundamental rights around the world, published the SA8000 standard in 1997. It \nis currently the leading social certification standard for factories and companies around \nthe world. SA8000 measures social performance in eight areas important to social \naccountability in workplaces, anchored by a management system element that drives \ncontinuous improvement in all areas of the standard (child labour, forced or \ncompulsory labour, health and safety, freedom of association and right to collective \nbargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours, remuneration and \nmanagement system).  \n \nThe standard comes with a set of resources to help companies measure and improve their \nmanagement and performance systems in order to meet the standard’s requirements. An \nindependent evaluation is then carried out by an accredited entity (at present, none of the \naccredited entities is French).  \n \n B-Corp certification, aimed at promoting a more accountable, transparent business \nmodel with a positive environmental impact, was launched in 2007 by US-based NGO  \nB-Lab (whose founder sought to reform the economic system to include a civic focus). \nThis certification is awarded to companies that have extra-financial social and/or \nenvironmental objectives in line with the required accounting and transparency \nrequirements.  \n \nTo obtain B-Corp certification (which is reassessed every two years), a company must get \nenough points on a 200-question survey covering various themes such as governance, \nstakeholders, the business model, accounting, staff, wages, ecological impacts, etc. B-\nCorp certification also has a community-based, participative dimension: the B-Corp \ncommunity joins together in working groups to improve its practices. Thus, since it was \ncreated, B-Corp certification has fostered a community in around 50 countries, comprising \nmore than 1,600 certified companies (around 30 French companies currently hold this \ncertification, including Natures & Découvertes, Camif and Birdéo). Obtaining this label \nturns into a communication issue on a corporate entity’s commitment to environmental \nissues.  \n \n \n\n-73- \n \nThe development of “environmental profit & loss” statements in large European \ncompanies has paved the way for including a company’s resource use in its operations \nand strategy \nOver the past few years, environmental or integrated accounting methodologies have been \ndeveloped in companies. Examples include the “Environmental Profit & Loss” (EP&L) \ndeveloped by Kering and the “Integrated Profit & Loss” developed by BASF. The task force \nmet with these companies. \nKering’s EP&L is a pioneering initiative in environmental profit & loss accounting. This \nreporting and accounting management tool has become an operating resource for reducing \nthe business’s environmental footprint across the full value chain \nThe Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) was launched in 2011 by Puma (which was a \nKering group company at the time). The EP&L was rolled out for the full Kering group in \n2015 (the group’s main brands are Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Boucheron, Bottega Veneta \nand Alexander McQueen). The EP&L aims to provide a comprehensive view of the \ngroup’s business in order to measure its environmental impact, to translate that impact \ninto monetary terms, and to implement solutions to reduce the impact significantly (in \nterms of the supply chain, manufacturing processes or the transformation of raw materials). \nAn “EP&L intensity” metric is also published. Kering thus seeks to meet the requirements of \nthe Natural Capital Protocol. Its methodology is designed in collaboration with PwC (see \nAppendix 10 for a more detailed description of the method). \nTo measure its environmental impact, Kering looks at CO2 emissions, water consumption and \npollution, soil use, air pollution and waste production across the supply chain (raw materials > \ntransformation of raw materials > manufacturing > assembly > operations and retail shops). \nThen, the EP&L translates this environmental impact into a monetary amount in order \nto have a metric and an overview of the environmental costs of the business. This \nmonetary translation is carried out by PwC consultants and updated every three years in \ncollaboration with Kering.62 More generally, it leverages “Science-Based Targets” (SBTs) \nand allows Kering to update its sustainable development strategy with regard to the \nenvironment, water and biodiversity. Thus, Kering’s sustainable development goal set in 2017 \nwas to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across the full value chain by 40% by 2025.  \nThe environmental challenges and opportunities highlighted by the EP&L therefore help the \ngroup define guidance, metrics and quantified goals in order to improve raw material \nmanagement: the group’s main suppliers are involved in the EP&L (from raw material \nproduction to final product assembly), thus strengthening collaboration for controlling the \nenvironmental impact of business by using sustainable resources (thanks to implementation of \nsupply standards) or, if necessary, harnessing innovations (in order to replace raw materials \ndeemed unsustainable in EP&L terms).  \nKering uses the EP&L in connection with its “Kering Standards” for raw materials and \nmanufacturing processes. These standards are revised annually and should allow for: \ncompliance with the precautionary principle when using technology; compliance with \ninternational and national regulations; secure and verifiable traceability; compliance with the \nmost stringent animal welfare standards; preventing the deterioration or destruction of natural \necosystems; committing to a reduction in climate impacts; guaranteeing ethical treatment of \npeople working on the supply chain. For instance, the standard for silk covers mulberry silk, \n                                                           \n62 Kering reserves the right to challenge PwC’s assumptions used for this calculation. \n\n-74- \n \nwhich accounts for 95% of global silk production, and focuses on the early stages of \nsericulture (cultivating silkworm cocoons and spinning) in order to make the activities as \nsustainable as possible, to reduce chemical additives, to ensure efficient, responsible use of \nwater and renewable energies, and to guarantee stringent standards for working conditions: at \nthe very least, users of silk within the group must ask for details on the origins of the silk and \nmust make every effort to include certified organic silk in their supply chain.  \nOn a more practical level, a mobile app for the group’s product designers applies the EP&L \nmethodology as a means to visualise the environmental impact of certain standard products, \nfrom raw material extraction to sales, for four kinds of luxury goods. The environmental \nimpact is shown in geographic terms and based on the design and supply choices.  \nWe note that Kering works closely with the European Commission, France’s Ministry for the \nEcological and Inclusive Transition, the UK Environment Agency, and China’s Ministry of \nEcology and Environment in order to expand its EP&L. Efforts are ongoing but are not far \nenough along to be communicated by Kering or the aforementioned public authorities.  \nBASF’s “Value to Society P&L”, an integrated accounting resource that covers \nenvironmental and social impacts and is ultimately intended to feed into the company’s \nintegrated reporting  \nSince 2013, German petrochemical and agrochemical group BASF has been developing an \nintegrated P&L known as “Value to Society”. It is substantially based on a methodology \nsimilar to that of Kering. It nevertheless encompasses social impacts and reflects the positive \nand negative effects of its business. Like Kering, BASF relies on valuation methods designed \nby PwC.  \nBASF’s method covers the full value chain (corporate level > project level > business unit & \nproduct level) and includes the following categories: (i) economic (profit, depreciation and \nwrite-downs); (ii) social (taxes, wages and related income, human capital, workplace health \nand safety); and (iii) environmental (air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, soil use, water \nconsumption and pollution, waste). \nThe “Value to Society” method yielded a positive impact from 2013 to 2017, with the total \nimpact spread evenly across economic, social and environmental aspects.  \nAside from their obvious usefulness and innovative aspects, the initiatives spearheaded by \nKering and BASF currently lack standardisation (notably with regard to the scope of \napplication and the key metrics) and thus comparability. For example, the social value of \ncarbon varies significantly amongst the companies that publish an environmental and/or social \nP&L.  \nThe absence of standardisation therefore makes it impossible to audit EP&L or Value to \nSociety P&L, particularly on the databases used or on monetary translation methodologies. \nThese shortcomings thus result in companies using EP&L or Value to Society P&L as a \ndefinite communication and operational tool, and only to a slighter extent as a strategic \nreporting tool throughout their value chain. \nAside from a lack of commitment to a social value of carbon in line with international \nrecommendations, this absence of standardisation is partly the result of the lack of key \nmetrics for environmental and social issues. Such metrics could drive convergence in the \nmethodologies developed by these companies.  \n\n-75- \n \nTherefore, in March 2019, BASF was a leader in the launch of the Integrated P&L – \nShaping the future of accounting initiative, alongside BNP Paribas, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, \nLafarge Holcim, Novartis, Olam and PwC, amongst other companies, and including \nparticipation from academics, the Natural Capital Coalition and the IIRC. This initiative aims \nto set up an NGO with a limited lifespan of three years in order to standardise a model for \nintegrated accounting and environmental/social impact valuation, to align these companies’ \nreporting approaches and make them genuine resources for determining strategy, and lastly, to \npublish the results through the OECD in close cooperation with the World Bank and the \nEuropean Commission’s Environment Directorate-General.  \n \nCompanies are subject to increased pressure and closer scrutiny from NGOs  \nNGOs have gradually taken on a driving role in critically analysing companies’ extra-\nfinancial performance. Thus, over time, they have become key stakeholders for companies, \nenabling business to consolidate commitments to sustainable development and to enhance \nrelations with all stakeholders (in some cases via partnerships). Conversely, NGOs can also \nexert pressure by increasing scrutiny on companies’ sustainable development actions. \nExtra-financial reporting is a key part of this, both as a business transparency tool and as a \nprerequisite for developing sustainable finance.  \nWith this in mind, some 20 NGOs published an appeal to the European Commission in late \nNovember 2018: “The European Commission must take action to improve the reporting \nobligations of companies on sustainability issues”.63 This appeal included detailed \nrecommendations (such as including an extra-financial statement in the annual report; laying \nout a clear structure for companies’ extra-financial reporting; specifying reporting \nrequirements across the value chain; bolstering requirements in terms of monitoring and \ncontrolling extra-financial reporting; ensuring the implementation throughout each company’s \necosystem, including SMEs; extending executives’ fiduciary duties to include sustainability \nstrategy and targets; facilitating data centralisation in open data format, and specifying \nminimum sector metrics to ensure standardisation and comparability of extra-financial \ninformation). The NGOs signing this appeal included WWF, Transparency International, \nOxfam, ShareAction, Amnesty International and Global Witness.  \nMore broadly, NGOs have gradually taken on the topic of extra-financial reporting by \nramping up their staff, especially teams working with European institutions in Brussels, \nand by participating in the European Commission’s efforts (including the Technical \nExperts Group as part of the action plan on sustainable finance) and the European Reporting \nLab@EFRAG (mentioned above).  \nIn 2018, several NGOs (Transparency International, WWF, CORE Coalition, Future Fit \nFoundation, Business and Human Rights Resource Center) created the Alliance for Corporate \nTransparency,64 a three-year research project tasked with assessing progress in the ESR \nreporting and transparency of European firms. This alliance published its first report in March \n2019. The task force’s analysis of the action of private actors has thus revealed a very \nlarge number of initiatives, the structuring of which - particularly between companies \nand NGOs - is still in its early stages. \n                                                           \n63 \nhttp://corporatejustice.org/news/11351-ngos-call-on-the-eu-commission-to-clarify-the-legal-framework-for-\ncorporate-sustainability-reporting \n64 https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/ \n\n-76- \n \n \n \n\n-77- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAPTER 2 \n \nEXTRA-FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTENTS: FROM \nMULTIPLE FRAMEWORKS TO CONVERGING \nSTANDARDS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-78- \n \nIn the following sections, currently-available frameworks are examined in terms of the \ncontents of the reporting. In Section 3.1, frameworks that focus on the principles for extra-\nfinancial disclosure or the reporting structure are reviewed. \n \nFrameworks that emphasise the substance or content of extra-financial information can be \ncategorised according to their objectives:  \n \n Some frameworks have a general aim, seeking to handle all the extra-financial subjects \ndeemed relevant by their promoters. These are reviewed in Section 2.1; \n \n Some general frameworks have a strong sector focus (i.e. “sector frameworks”). These are \nassessed in Section 2.2; \n \n Other frameworks have a theme-based approach aimed at promoting an in-depth analysis \nof a chosen theme. Frameworks focusing on climate and the environment are examined in \nSection 2.3, while other theme-based frameworks are reviewed in Section 2.4; \n \n Lastly, frameworks with a general approach to companies covering intangibles are \nreviewed in Section 2.5.  \n \nEach framework is analysed based on how long it has been in existence. The abundance of \ndifferent frameworks mentioned earlier in this report is reflected in a wide range of \napproaches. After describing and assessing the main frameworks, the issue of the \ncompatibility or complementary fit between different approaches must be addressed.  \n \nThe following sections do not claim to be exhaustive. The emphasis is on the main \nframeworks mentioned during the task force’s work, and there may be unintentional \nomissions. \n \n\n-79- \n \n2.1 General frameworks represent substantial progress in terms of \ncontent but could still be improved \nGeneral frameworks that emphasise the content of extra-financial information currently stand \nat various levels of completion but none of them appears to be finalised at present. \n \nA general framework with a 20-year track record and wide recognition: the Global \nReporting Initiative (GRI) standards \n \nThe corpus of GRI standards was published in 2016 (and has been supplemented since then \non some points). Its structure and developments aim to provide comprehensive coverage of \nextra-financial subjects. It is more than 500 pages long, and is divided into two parts: \n \n The first part, around 100 pages long, contains “Universal Standards”. This is the GRI \n100 series. \n The second part, more than 400 pages long, includes “Topic-specific Standards” \ncovering three selected themes: economy (GRI 200 series), environment (GRI 300 series) \nand society (GRI 400 series). \n \nThe universal standards cover both the “foundation” (basic principles, GRI 101), general \ndisclosures (GRI 102) and the management approach (GRI 103). Some of these standards \n(notably those related to reporting quality) are analysed in comparative terms in Section 2.2, \nbut it is worth noting here a few distinctive features of the GRI approach: \n \n From the foundation (GRI 101), we note: \n \n− An inclusive view, which determines stakeholders on a broad and comprehensive \nbasis. This is a key factor for the approach, which aims to incorporate all stakeholders, \neven those that are not necessarily in a position to easily express their expectations. \n− A view of materiality that is based on the organisation’s impacts on all fields in the \nreporting (or on the conditions in which the various stakeholders must give their \nopinions or make decisions). Materiality is thus viewed as reflecting the organisation’s \nimpacts on the economy, the environment or society, and not as taking into account \nthe risks that the economy, the environment or society can raise for the organisation. \n− A certain degree of flexibility in implementation thanks to a choice of two different \nlevels: a “core” or minimum level, which is rooted in selecting information needed to \nbe in compliance, and a “comprehensive” level that provides for more information to \nbe reported. In practical terms, the report can be stand-alone or included with other \ndocuments using a system of cross-references. An organisation may decide to apply \nonly some standards, with appropriate information about this partial implementation. \nIn any case, GRI must be informed that its standards are being used either \ncomprehensively or in part. \n \n General disclosures (GRI 102) are mainly connected to governance and cover 56 \nheadings: \n \n\n-80- \n \n− 13 disclosures related to the organisation’s profile. Note information on the supply \nchain and use of the precautionary principle. \n− 2 headings related to the organisation’s sustainability strategy, with a more “policy” \nfocus: management statement on this subject, and a general analysis of key impacts, \nrisks and opportunities. \n− 2 headings on ethics and integrity: a description of values and norms of behaviour for \nthe organisation, and mechanisms for advice and concerns about ethics. \n− 22 headings related to governance: general governance structure, with a strong \nemphasis on sustainability governance. \n− 5 headings on stakeholder engagement: list of stakeholder groups, procedures for \nstakeholder relations, identifying key topics of concern. \n− 12 headings related to reporting practice, including the list of material topics, the level \nof reporting chosen and any possible outside oversight. The list of material topics \n(GRI 102.47) is a crucial stage in the process that must be connected to the \nmanagement approach mentioned below. This stage sets up the reporting framework in \nwhich the organisation has decided to position itself by listing the major topics on \nwhich it will report based on the significant impact for stakeholders. \nOverall, this general information gives a fairly broad overview of the organisation and its \nactivities, as well as a more detailed description of its governance procedures, notably with \nregard to sustainability matters. \n \n As for the management approach (GRI 103), the requested information is supposed to \nprovide a fairly detailed explanation of each major selected theme listed in application of \nGRI 102.47: \n \n− An explanation of the material topic and its “Boundary” (i.e. direct and/or indirect \nimpacts) is required first of all.  \n− Then, the company’s approach must, in theory, be described comprehensively: \npolicies implemented and commitments made, goals and targets, resources used, any \nmechanisms for handling damage, and assessment mechanisms for the management’s \napproach. \n− To round out the listed information, the standard sets a fairly high level of \nrequirements in principle, notably within a dynamic perspective. However, these \nrequirements are dependent on the organisation having a structured process for the \ntopic in question (“if the management approach includes that component”). Thus, \nincentives are given, but the standard is pragmatic inasmuch as an organisation can \nadapt its reporting to its own level of structure for the topic. \n \nThe GRI 200 series (around 60 pages long) addresses economic topics, with six standards \nincluding 13 topic-specific disclosures. This series is fairly general and appears to have \nsome difficulty positioning the information suggested therein compared to information in \nother reports (such as the management report). We have the following observations: \n \n The connection with financial information lacks structure. The standard for economic \nperformance (GRI 201) is written from the perspective of direct economic value generated \nand distributed, from a standpoint more closely connected to national accounts and \nmacroeconomic aspects than with the organisation’s performance per se. If the major \n\n-81- \n \ncategories mentioned here are presumably of an accounting nature, they do not seem to \nhave been reconciled with the actual financial statements. \n \n Climate change is addressed in terms of economic performance, but very succinctly (in a \npage and a half). Here, the focus is not on impacts, but on risks and opportunities for the \norganisation. While the methods presented are generally relevant, there are no metrics. \nGranted, GRI addressed this issue in 2016, prior to the TCFD. \n \n For the rest, the information required addresses the main economic themes generally cited \nby stakeholders as a list of qualitative and/or quantitative information related to: \n \n− Pension schemes \n− Government aid received \n− Starting salaries and percentage of “local” executives \n− Indirect impacts, especially in terms of infrastructure and “public” services \n− Purchasing policies, notably with regard to “local” suppliers \n− Anti-corruption practices \n− Anti-competitive behaviour \n \nThe GRI 300 series (around 120 pages long) addresses environmental topics, with eight \nstandards including 32 topic-specific disclosures. \n \nThe eight standards cover raw materials, energy, water and effluents, biodiversity, greenhouse \ngas emissions, effluents and waste, environmental compliance, and supplier environmental \nassessment. We have the following observations: \n \n These topics focus on the main environmental concerns, and the standards initially call for \ndescribing the various legal contexts that the company may face due to its geographical \nsetup in different countries and the policies it has implemented on all topics. \n \n The information has a largely quantitative focus (e.g. weight and volume of materials \nused, electricity consumption, volume of treated wastewater, volume of toxic emissions, \netc.). \n \n Some topics are also viewed in terms of trends or goals to be achieved: this is the case for \ntreatment of wastewater (303-1) and for potential biodiversity impacts (304-2), where the \ncompany’s impact on its environment can be assessed. \n \nThe GRI 400  series addresses social aspects and is the largest portion, with 19 standards \nand more than 36 minimal disclosure headings, covering all aspects of labour law (including \nlabour/management relations, occupational health and safety, training and education, diversity \nand equal opportunity, pay and benefits, workplace security, human rights, local labour law, \netc.), supplier relations (and suppliers’ enforcement of labour law) and client relations \n(product information and handling of disputes). We have the following observations: \n \n The standards focus primarily on getting an explanation of the regulatory environment in \nwhich the company operates and describing its current procedures. \n \n\n-82- \n \nThe information requested is very comprehensive and detailed. It is mainly quantitative and \ndescribes the environment and working conditions for employees (e.g. the number of \nemployees hired over the period, the number of employees on parental leave, the percentage \nof employees returning to work after parental leave, etc.) \n \nAll this information in the GRI 200, 300 and 400 is worthwhile but it is more list than an \norderly set of economic data that would give a coherent overview of the organisation’s \neconomic impacts. While this information is interesting, the stakeholders interviewed by the \ntask force, and investors in particular, often noted that this information is general and of \nrelative usefulness.  \n \nGRI has also developed sector-specific metrics rolled out with the G4 in the early 2010s for \njust ten business sectors:65 airport operators, construction and real estate, electric utilities, \nevent organisers, financial services, food processing, media, mining and metals, NGOs, and \noil and gas. These sector metrics are a supplement to the standard corpus and are still \napplicable today. On 4 April, GRI launched a new sector programme66 to develop sector \nstandards by calling for applicants for “project working groups” (15 members each) for each \nof the two priority sectors selected (“oil and gas” and “agriculture”), with the objective of \npublishing these standards by the end of 2020. Note that in the meantime, the previous sector \nstandards remain applicable. The GRI governing bodies have asked for a mapping with the \nSASB framework as part of this project (see the comparative analysis of the three selected \nsectors in Section 2.2).  \n \nFollowing this in-depth examination, the task force regards GRI as having contributed to the \norderly development of retrospective non-financial information that is fairly comprehensive, \nbut its application principles leave a wide leeway to flexibility and can therefore detract from \nthe forward-looking dimension, comparability and relevance of the information: \n GRI recommends a standardised grid of approaches and analyses for all governance, \nenvironmental and social topics. This exhaustiveness has ensured its success with a large \nnumber of major companies worldwide required to publish ESR data (i.e. 70% of the 250 \nlargest global firms that publish an ESR report state that they use GRI as their reference). \nThis gives the GRI approach a certain degree of comparability, based on the use of a \ncommon taxonomy. \n \n The metrics allow for a relatively comprehensive overview of governance, environmental \nand social topics, but they are mainly descriptive and quantitative. Contrary to the GRE \nstandards’ recommendations, few of these metrics focus on the company’s strategy or \nongoing actions, and they are not well connected to the financial strategy. \n \n Moreover, the organisations that report using the GRI principles have considerable leeway \nin their reporting and can choose to publish using the core framework or the \ncomprehensive framework. They can then select the metrics that they consider to be the \nmost relevant and suitable for their business, in a “comply or explain” approach. Lastly, \nthey define their own specific calculation methods for a certain number of metrics. The \napplication of these rules and reporting are not uniform across organisations, even though \nthey are relevant over time for a given organisation. Comparability of publications is \n                                                           \n65 https://www.globalreporting.org/information/sector-guidance/Pages/default.aspx  \n66https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/work-program-and-standards-review/gri-sector-\nprogram/?dm_i=4J5,67ONU,QM6U1D,OH2UG,1  \n\n-83- \n \ntherefore not as strong, and reference must be made to additional information before any \ncomparability exercises can be carried out. Hence GRI’s choice to continue to develop \nsector standards. \nReference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): a comprehensive approach \nbroken down at the corporate disclosure level \nTo materialise the global approach in the Sustainable Development Goals, the 17 SDGs are \nbroken down into 169 targets, then 244 indicators (even though these indicators have received \nless media attention are less well-known by stakeholders and are only partially defined): \nGoals \nTargets \nIndicators \nSDG 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere \n7 \n14 \nSDG 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition \nand promote sustainable agriculture  \n8 \n13 \nSDG 3.

Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the \nglobal partnership for sustainable development \n19 \n25 \n\n-84- \n \nThe SDGs have the advantage of having been adopted worldwide: they are therefore a \nuniversal benchmark that is binding for governments and all stakeholders. For companies, the \ndifficulty lies in breaking the SDGs down to their level: \n The goals and targets are generic and are mainly addressed to governments to guide their \nsustainable development strategy. The indicators break down the various targets and are \nall quantitative, but they do not give exact definitions of the terms used. An observation at \na given point (i.e. at the starting point) allows progress to be measured compared to the \ndetermined target (i.e. the end point). The trend in indicators over time is the truly relevant \nmetric. \n \n Of course, not all SDGs are applicable to private companies, which are just one kind of \nstakeholder for overall sustainable development. In addition, their potential involvement \ndepends on their business sector.67 However, given their economic and social role, \ncompanies have an important part to play, and in analysing their value chain, which \nincludes many stakeholders (employees, clients, suppliers, local government, regional \nplayers, etc.), they can contribute to many SDGs, especially those related to production \nand labour. Thus, the aim for a company is to identify the SDGs that it can contribute to \nand to quantify its own targets prior to monitoring its progress. \n \n Within the UN, the Global Compact initiative, launched in 2000, is directly targeted to \ngiving companies worldwide the incentives to adopt a socially-responsible attitude. In this \nframework, companies commit to adopting and promoting the SDGs:68 \n \n− The ten Global Compact principles lay a foundation for a simple, universal and \nvoluntary framework based on four categories:  \n \ni. \nHuman rights (1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of \ninternationally proclaimed human rights; and 2. Make sure that they are not \ncomplicit in human rights abuses)  \nii. \nEnvironment (3. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to \nenvironmental challenges; \n4. Undertake initiatives \nto \npromote greater \nenvironmental responsibility; and 5. Encourage the development and diffusion of \nenvironmentally friendly technologies) \niii. \nLabour (6. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective \nrecognition of the right to collective bargaining; 7. The elimination of all forms of \nforced and compulsory labour; 8. The effective abolition of child labour; and \n9. The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation) \niv. \nAnti-corruption (10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, \nincluding extortion and bribery) \n− Thus, the Global Compact has the ambition of being a “catalyst and supporter of \ncommitments, actions and innovations by companies [...] and has the objective of \ntranslating these SDGs into ‘business’ language”.69  \n− In order to support companies in this voluntary approach, and in order to better define \nthe relevant indicators, the Global Compact approached GRI in 2017-2018 to propose \n                                                           \n67 Thus, an agri-food company can specifically contribute to SDG 2, whereas a medical company can contribute \nmore broadly to SDG 3. \n68 Ban Ki-moon, then Secretary-General of the United Nations, stated: “Businesses must give concrete meaning \nto their actions and must respect the ties between all cultures and peoples.” (2012) \n69 Source: UN Global Compact website, consulted on 1 April 2019. https://www.globalcompact-france.org/p-\n136-les-odd-et-le-global-compact. \n\n-85- \n \na practical guide70 on SDG reporting explaining the approach to be adopted (i.e. the \nmain principles to be retained in the choice of priority actions to be carried out by the \norganisation; the definition of its own business targets by SDG, the selection and \nmonitoring of relevant indicators) and proposing a “transition table” between the \nSDGs and the GRI indicators. \n− Tim Mohin, GRI Chief Executive, thus stated when publishing the Global Compact-\nGRI 2017 guide Business Reporting on the SDGs: An analysis of the goals and \ntargets: “At a time when the revenues of large companies exceed the GDP of many \ncountries and supply chains stretch around the world, the private sector plays a vital \nrole in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. This analysis of the goals and \ntargets is a first step towards a unified mechanism to help companies report on the \nSDGs in a comparable and effective way. By reporting on their progress, companies \nwill improve their performance which will enable meaningful progress towards \nachieving the SDGs.” \n− As an example, concerning target 13.1 (“Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to \nclimate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries”) of SDG 13 (“Climate \nAction”), the guide identifies a series of company-specific themes (e.g. monitoring \nclimate change risks and opportunities) and available reporting fields corresponding to \nthis specific theme (e.g. the identification of climate change risks to society, in \nparticular those relating to the company's potential to bring about substantial changes \nin the company's business, income or expenses, namely: risk factor; description; \npotential impact; timeframe; direct/indirect impact; magnitude of impact...), their unit \nof measurement (if available) and metric (e.g. Climate Disclosure Project framework). \nThe guide mentioned above offers advice to companies on how to integrate SDGs into \ntheir non-financial reporting, in particular on the interconnections to be made between \nSDGs throughout the value chain of an activity. The indicators themselves are not \ndetailed and do not offer a precise calculation formula. \n− Companies have become increasingly aware of their social role and many of them \nhave adopted a communication related to the SDGs, even if it remains partial on the \nobjectives deemed relevant for them. (78% of French Afep/Medef member companies \nsurveyed as part of the task force’s assignment declare that they are either in \ncompliance or partially using the SDGs.) \nWithout constituting a reference framework per se, the SDGs therefore propose a universal \nframework for reflection on all aspects of CSR, constituting a significant paradigm shift in the \naction of companies in terms of sustainable development.  \nThe Global Compact, which remains the foundation of companies' commitment to the United \nNations, allows companies to both implement the ten founding principles and provide \nconcrete support for the MDGs. As objectives, SDGs are action commitments that are \nrelatively well internalised by companies, particularly in the context of defining their strategy. \nThe MDGs enable them to build a bridge between civil society's expectations in terms of \nsustainable development and their contribution, even if these expectations are most often \nfocused on themes related to the sovereign functions of States. Generally speaking, although \ncompanies are still in the process of adopting the SDGs, they recognise the relevance of the \nSDGs in order to clarify their strategy while highlighting the important work involved in the \nconcrete and operational implementation of these 17 goals and their targets.  \n \n \n                                                           \n70 Business Reporting on the SDGs: « Integrating the SDGs into corporate reporting: a practical guide », \nAugust 2018. \n\n-86- \n \nA more recent general purpose approach based on a sectoral approach: SASB indicators \nLike the practices of the international accounting standard setters IASB and FASB, the SASB \nstandards are developed by reference to a conceptual framework, the latest version of which \nwas adopted in February 2017. 71 \n \nThe approach is implemented on the basis of two deliberate choices justified in the conceptual \nframework: \n The standards are industry-specific,72 in order to focus on relevance and \ncomparability; and \n The standards are intended to inform investors,73 which places the approach in a \ntargeted, and therefore not necessarily inclusive, perspective. \nThe SASB framework is based on five main dimensions for the development of its standards:  \n The environment \n Social capital \n The employees \n The business model \n Innovation and the managerial dimension. \nThe SASB describes its standards as originally designed to prepare certain information for \ninclusion in the MD&A and other relevant sections of documents to be filed with the SEC, but \nnow states that it is not limited to US companies. The standards are voluntary and can be used \nin conjunction with other sustainability reporting models.  \n \nThis conceptual framework sets out the principles for developing standards by sector of \nactivity. Thus, for each of the sectors analysed, the aim is to:  \n \n Determine the relevant dimensions (five dimensions in 30 subjects); and \n \n Identify significant (material) elements that are useful to an investor and easy to \nimplement with low costs: \n \n- By focusing the analysis of relevant topics on the potential impact on the company's \nvalue, the investor's interest, relevance to the sector, the feasibility of implementation and \nwhether or not a consensus between issuers and investor is reflected; \n- According to the criteria of faithful representation, usefulness, applicability, \ncomparability, completeness, verifiability, alignment with other existing criteria, \nneutrality and dispersion; and \n- The characteristics of information obtained that is objective, measurable, complete and \nrelevant. \n                                                           \n71 Initial version published in 2013. \n72 “Each industry has its own sustainability profile” (CF, p4). 11 industries subdivided into 79 sectors initially, \nthen reduced to 77. Industry and sector nomenclature set in the Sustainable Industry Classification System \n(SICS). \n73 “SASB standards are intended to help issuers identify and more effectively disclose the information today’s \ninvestor need to make informed decisions” (CF, p6) to support “fundamental analysis, comparison and \nbenchmarking, portfolio management, active engagement” (CF, p7). \n\n-87- \n \nAfter five years of analysis of the practices of large international issuers and the work of \nspecific working groups by sector of activity (also including members of European \ncompanies), the SASB proposed a relatively small number of indicators per sector: from \naround ten indicators to a maximum of thirty, depending on the relevance of the subjects \naccording to the importance of the impact of environmental and social issues in the sector \nconcerned.  \nIndicators are retroactive and can be either quantitative (in amounts or percentages) or \ndescriptive (e.g. corporate policies).  \nIn total, all sectors combined, 981 indicators are proposed (253 descriptive and 728 \nquantitative). No positioning with respect to a given target or strategy is required by the \nindicators. The application of this standard remains voluntary on a comply-or-explain basis. \nBy construction, the SASB does not offer a common indicator for all sectors, even if some \nthemes are regularly repeated and more or less modified: the search for intra-sector \ncomparability is privileged. Some topics of interest may be found from one standard to \nanother without the underlying indicators being systematically the same.  \nDue to their recent publication, these standards are not applied by a large number of \ncompanies at this stage,74 but the simplicity of their implementation seems likely to appeal to \nsome issuers. \nThe SASB offers a specific reference framework for each sector of activity with quantitative, \ndescriptive and essentially retrospective data. The targeted and pragmatic nature of the \napproach has clear advantages, even if it can be simplistic, especially in the absence of a \ncommon core, as illustrated by the comparative analysis presented in Section 2.2 below. \nWork is underway to harmonise the various criteria in the framework of (i) works with the \nCDSB and SASB on the implementation of the TCFD’s recommendations (report issued on 1 \nMay 2019); and (ii) as part of the Corporate Reporting Dialogue between the five bodies \nproposing extra-financial reference frameworks (see Section 2.6). \n                                                           \n74 Only 18% of French Afep/Medef member companies interviewed by the task force stated that they were either \nin compliance or partial compliance with SASB. \n\n-88- \n \n2.2 Sector or industry standards, originating from general frameworks, \nwhich are slated to either supplement or replace the latter, do have \npractical advantages but may be somewhat simplistic \nFor a number of years, the search for heightened relevance of extra-financial information has \nprompted the above-mentioned standard-setting bodies to roll out a sector-specific \nstandardisation policy. Its goal is to foster comparisons by highlighting the “business line” \nrelevance.  \n \nIn light of the foregoing, the task force sought to compare the sector-specific approach of \nthe reporting frameworks most often used by businesses, namely those of the GRI and \nthe SASB. It chose to look at reporting topics and their related metrics in three separate \nindustries: oil and gas, media and entertainment, and food processing.  \n \nThese industries were chosen for the following reasons:  \n Each covers one or more sectors of the economy (the extractive and food processing \nindustries belong to the primary and secondary sectors whereas media and entertainment \nare part of the tertiary sector);   \n \n They have an international dimension, in particular as regards the value chain for the oil \nand gas, and food processing industries, and   \n \n Their operations take in environmental, social and societal issues which are of special \nsignificance in light of the ecological, social and digital transitions. \nThe comparison draws on the GRI’s G4 Guidelines and their Sector Supplements (for the \nrelevant sectors), on one hand, and the industry standards published by the SASB in October \n2018, on the other (see section 2.1). Although the GRI’s general standards, which became \nmandatory for reporting by user companies alone in July 2018, have replaced the existing G4 \nSector Disclosures, the latter are still recommended for businesses operating in the relevant \nsectors.75 \n \nIn early February 2019, the GRI unveiled its GRI Sector Program76 as, with an eye to \nachieving the SDGs, it considers that extra-financial reporting requires greater clarity. This \napplies in particular to each sector’s most significant impacts as regards sustainable \ndevelopment. The GRI’s sector prioritisation, on the basis of the Due Process Protocol, led to \nwork being started in Q1 2019 on the oil, gas and coal sector, on one hand, and the agriculture \nsector, on the other. These two standards, that are set to replace the current G4 Sector \nDisclosures, are scheduled to be published for public consultation before the end of 2019. \nThey should be definitively approved by the GRI’s Global Sustainability Standards Board in \nJune 2020.   \n \nThe complementary aspects and differences between these two frameworks allow the \npriorities, merits and shortcomings of each of them to be pinpointed and for conclusions to be \n                                                           \n75 Airport operators, construction and real estate, electric utilities, event organizers, financial services, food \nprocessing, media, mining and metals, NGOs and oil and gas.  \n76 Approved by the GRI’s Global Sustainability Standards Board on 7 February 2019.

This guidance applies to the entire oil \nand petroleum gas industrial process from deposits to the end consumer, and to the entire life \ncycle of oil and gas projects (from the environmental impact assessment stage to dismantling, \nand including the construction, operational and maintaining in operational conditions stages).  \n \nBesides the required General Standard Disclosures (i.e. strategy and analysis, organizational \nprofile, identified material aspects and boundaries, stakeholder engagement, report profile, \ngovernance, ethics and integrity), the GRI requires the sector to report on the following three \ncategories:  \n \n The economic category for which the required indicators are fairly commonplace and are \nconsistent with the GRI standards concerning economic indicators, namely:  \n \n− Payments to governments (required in France pursuant to Article L.225-102-3 of the \nCommercial Code for oil, gas and mining companies registered and/or listed in an EU \nMember State, in compliance with the EU Accounting and Transparency Directives); \n− Risks and opportunities relating to changes to the carbon price; \n− Market presence (including in particular local content); \n− Respect for community customs and values; \n− Procurement practices; and  \n− The volume and type of proved reserves of existing deposits77. \n \n The environmental category is comprehensive and contains a large number of indicators: \n \n− The materials used in the hydraulic fracturing process, including a battery of specific \nchemicals. This category applies more to companies which extract non-conventional \nhydrocarbons such as shale gas, the large majority of which are based in the United \nStates according to the International Energy Agency78; \n− Consumption and energy intensity – including the energy intensity of operations and \nthe amounts invested in renewable energy; \n− Water management, covering total water withdrawal by source and the water sources \nthat are significantly affected by withdrawal; \n− The company’s policy for protecting ecosystems and, in particular, biodiversity (local \ninitiatives; percentage of operating sites in which biodiversity risk has been assessed \nand monitored); \n                                                           \n77 Bearing in mind the fact that transparency concerning reserves is currently hard to achieve as standards are not \nharmonised at international level and as the International Energy Agency has no specific remit to monitor the \naccuracy of the reserves reported by the industry.   \n78 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2018.  \n\n-90- \n \n− Greenhouse gas emissions, taking in scopes 1, 2 and 3 and emissions of air pollutants; \nand \n− Effluents and waste relating to energy transformation. \n \n The social category, comprising issues concerning labour practices and decent work, \nhuman rights, society-related aspects and product responsibility: \n \n− Labour relations practices as regards the principles laid down by the International \nLabour Organization (working conditions, occupational safety and health management \nsystems, taking account of the specificities relating to vulnerable workers, \noccupational accidents and work-related diseases); \n− Practices regarding safety in the workplace and respect for human rights; \n− Respect for the rights of the indigenous peoples in the relevant activity zones; \n− Respect for local communities (impact assessment and mitigation, stakeholder \nengagement strategies, rollout of community development programmes) and the \nmonitoring of operations with potential negative impacts on local communities \n(including emergency preparedness and the capacity to react to emergencies, and  \ninvoluntary resettlement procedures for populations); \n− Implementation of anti-corruption policies; \n− Transparency of public polices and lobbying; \n− Monetary value of fines and non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws \nand regulations. \n \n In all, an oil and gas company is able to disclose information on 25 indicators, the \nmajority of which (13) belong to the social category. Out of these 25 indicators, the GRI \nhas flagged up five as being specific to the oil and gas industry: oil reserves, \nemergency preparedness, involuntary resettlement of populations, asset integrity and \nprocess safety, and fossil fuel substitutes.   \n \nExamining the above-mentioned reporting topics and the related metrics reveals a fairly high \nlevel of qualitative reporting that refers to conventional international and/or sector standards \n(for instance, use of the guidance established by the IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry \nassociation for environmental and social issues, which represents over half of worldwide oil \nproduction). Quantitative data is usually required in the environmental category whilst it \ncomes as no surprise that the social category refers more widely to qualitative data.  \nBesides the reference to materials used in the hydraulic fracturing process which primarily \napplies to the sector’s companies based in the US, most of the reporting indicators have \ninternational reach. \n \nBut, there are no indicators covering the industry’s energy efficiency which is, however, \ncrucial as part of the energy transition. \n \nFor instance, the GRI standards core index table (i.e. “common core” standards, followed by \nthe indicators which the company considered substantive) and Total’s CSR reporting, \npublished by Total in 2017,79 demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the GRI in terms of \nreporting, whilst remaining in line with the company’s practices – due to the fact that all the \n                                                           \n79 \nTotal, \n2017 \nGRI \nStandards \nCore \nIndex. Available \nonline: \nhttps://www.sustainable-\nperformance.total.com/en/reporting/reporting-standards/global-reporting-initiative-gri  \n\n-91- \n \nreporting topics tabled by the GRI were published in the corresponding reports (i.e. \nRegistration Document (annual report); Climate Report; Human Rights Briefing Paper and \nSustainable Performance Website). In this respect, discussions between the task force and \nTotal representatives brought to light some correlation with the GRI whose materiality \nprinciple provides a certain flexibility when using the standards. \nThe SASB industry standards for the oil and gas sector appear to lack exhaustiveness and \nfinancial materiality, and too narrowly focus on the North American industry.  \n \nThe oil and gas industry standards drawn up by the SASB in October 2018 are broken down \ninto three separate standards which are specific to each stage of the value chain, with each \nhaving its own indicators: one covering “upstream” operations (exploration and production); \none covering “midstream” operations (industrial refining and petrochemical activities); and \none covering “downstream” operations (distribution and marketing). Service activities are \ndealt with separately. Stakeholder consultation on the standards began in late 2013 and there \nwere several phases of dialogue, the last of which took place in early 2018 (prior to \npublication of the standards in October 2018).  \n \nThe task force focused on the exploration and production standard due to the environmental \nand social issues connected with this phase of oil and gas development, and the changing \nnature of activities in this field (i.e. shale gas, offshore drilling and the deployment of \nrenewable energy). The standards on refining and distribution operations were subject to a \ntargeted analysis which is set out below. \n The exploration and production standard has 14 disclosure topics and 30 related metrics:  \n \n− Four environmental disclosure topics: greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1), air quality, \nwater management and biodiversity impacts; \n− Three social disclosure topics: security, human rights and rights of indigenous peoples, \ncommunity relations, and workforce health and safety; \n− A specific disclosure topic on reserves valuation and the deployment of renewable \nenergy; \n− Three governance disclosure topics: business ethics, management of the legal and \nregulatory environment, and risk management; and  \n− Three specific activity metrics (sharing the production of oil, natural gas, synthetic oil \nand synthetic gas in thousands of barrels per day, number of offshore sites and number \nof terrestrial sites). \n \n It should be noted that there are less comprehensive indicators and metrics compared \nto the GRI’s sector-specific guidance, in particular regarding the following aspects, the \nsubstance of which is nevertheless non-negligible for investors or other stakeholders:  \n \n− A number of indicators set out in the GRI’s sector-specific guidance do not appear in \nthe SASB standards. These include:  \n \nPayments to governments – the lack of this indicator may be due to the fact that \nthe SASB standards were initially destined for American companies as part of \ntheir reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. No taxes are levied at \nfederal level on oil and gas extraction and production companies as such taxation \nis at the initiative of the federal states; \n \nThe use of chemicals in the hydraulic fracturing process; \n \nEnergy intensity (of special importance for hydraulic fracturing); \n\n-92- \n \n \nEffluent and waste management; and \n \nGreenhouse gas emissions on scopes 2 and 3; scope 3 is still the most relevant for \nthe oil and gas industry (i.e. use of sold products, in particular for transportation, \nheating and cement)80. \n \n− A number of indicators are less detailed or are highly qualitative, unlike those of the \nGRI. These include:  \n \nRelations with local communities (local content, as described by the IPIECA in its \noil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting from 2010, \nprocurement practices and the local value chain, etc.); \n \nProtection of biodiversity; \n \nLabour relations and workforce health and safety: the SASB focuses on a number \nof metrics which do not allow for proper comparisons between companies on the \nbasis of the definition relating to each of them (i.e. frequency of declared \nincidents, breakdown of employees by type of employment contract, average \nnumber of training hours on these issues) and a reference to promoting a culture of \nsafety on the sites. As a result, these aspects demonstrate the bias in favour of \naddressing social issues in a highly quantitative manner and do not appear to be \ngeared towards full and complete compliance with international standards. \n \n In respect of the remaining indicators, the GRI and SASB standards are consistent in both \ntheir goals and reach.  \n \nConsequently, the following aspects should be highlighted, in terms of two factors: first, the \nSASB’s determination to focus on financial materiality and, secondly, the commitment to \noperate outside its initial borders:  \n \n The lack of key indicators for the oil and gas industry (i.e. scope 3 greenhouse gas \nemissions, waste management, workforce health and safety practices), which nevertheless \ncarry major financial materiality as regards the transition and litigation risks faced by the \nsector. \n \n The addition of new indicators compared to the industry’s practices and the \nrecommendations of extra-financial rating agencies, in particular in the standards \nconcerning refining and marketing activities. For instance, for its indicator regarding \nthe ecological impacts of the activity, the midstream standard requires the percentage of \nland owned, leased, and/or operated within areas of protected conservation status or \nendangered species habitat – whilst, currently, this type of metric is not sufficiently \noperational for oil companies operating on the international stage.   \n \n Reference to the disclosure of proved or probable reserves, namely those which are \nunproven from a commercial standpoint, has been strongly criticised by the industry and, \nin particular, by the IPIECA: \n                                                           \n80 For instance, for the years 2013 to 2017, Total reported on scopes 1, 2 and 3 (Climate Indicators” in MtCO2eq. \nAvailable online: https://www.sustainable-performance.total.com/en/climate-indicators. In 2017, its scope 1 \nemissions (operated direct GHG emissions, 100% of emissions from sites operated by the Group) were around \n36.2 MtCO2eq; its scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions) were around 3.8 MtCO2eq; and its scope 3 emissions \n(other indirect emissions: use by customers of products sold for end use – the most significant of the items \nrelating to the GHG Protocol) were around 400 MtCO2eq.  \n\n-93- \n \n \n“We are concerned with references to proven and probable reserves throughout \n(EM0101-11, EM0101-12, TA04-04-01, EM0101-20). We do not believe investors would \nbenefit from the disclosure of this additional reserves detail. Disclosure of this kind would \nbe detrimental and potentially misleading as it focuses on risks of future hypothetical \nchanges to the political or regulatory environment. These disclosures of reserves in \nspecific geographic areas are also more granular than those required under U.S. \nsecurities regulation and create competitive harm regardless of whether competitors have \nsimilar disclosure requirements. In addition, these proposed reserves disclosures are \nbased on the presumption that energy development in such areas cannot be done in a way \nthat mitigates risks”. \n \n(Excerpt from the letter of 10 January 2018 to Jean Rodgers, ex-Chair of the SASB from Brian \nSullivan, Executive Director of the IPIECA81). \n  \n The IPIECA referred to the “undue burden” created by transparency for the indicators and \nmetrics relating to the three standards (upstream, refining and downstream) as the majority \nof oil companies are now integrated and operate right across the value chain:  \n \n“SASB’s Exploration & Production, Midstream and Refining & Marketing Standards all \napply to integrated oil and gas companies. Performing a segment-by-segment materiality \nassessment and reporting on all of the metrics would place an undue burden on IOCs due \nto the organizational time and resources that would be required. We appreciate that SASB \nrecognizes companies are in the best position to determine their own material risks, but \nthird-party raters/rankers may suggest otherwise. This will likely lead to confusion as to \nwhat data should be reported, and potentially require companies to spend time and \nresources assessing what to report at the expense of improving performance. We believe \ninvestors are best served by understanding a company’s risk management approach and \nhaving confidence in a robust risk management process”.  \n \n(Excerpt from the letter of 10 January 2018 to Jean Rodgers, ex-Chair of the SASB from Brian \nSullivan, Executive Director of the IPIECA82). \n \n The majority of the metrics refer to the American legislative and regulatory \nframework, concerning, inter alia, the production of regulations by specialist agencies \n(Securities and Exchange Commission, Food and Drug Administration, Environmental \nProtection Agency, etc.), with very few addressing international standards (except, for \ninstance, protected geographical areas as regards biodiversity). \n \n As previously noted when examined the GRI standards, the publication of hydraulic \nfracturing indicators concerns almost exclusively American oil and gas exploration and \nproduction companies.  \n \n“With regards to accounting metric “TA04-03-01. Percentage of hydraulic fracturing \nsites where ground or surface water quality deteriorated compared to a baseline”, this is \nUS-centric and incorrectly assumes that similar sampling requirements to those in \nWyoming and Colorado are in place in other states and other nations, which is not the \ncase”.  \n                                                           \n81 Available online: https://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IPIECA_Letter_011218.pdf  \n82 Ibid. \n\n-94- \n \n \n(Excerpt from the letter of 10 January 2018 to Jean Rodgers, ex-Chair of the SASB from Brian \nSullivan, Executive Director of the IPIECA83). \n \n Against the backdrop of the SASB’s consultation of oil and gas industry stakeholders, the \nIPIECA compiled key ESG indicators for the industry, together with guidance, in 2015 \n(see table below). \n \nSource: IPIECA, Oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability reporting, 2015.84 \n \n \n                                                           \n83 Ibid.  \n84 Available online: http://www.ipieca.org/resources/good-practice/oil-and-gas-industry-guidance-on-voluntary-\nsustainability-reporting-3rd-edition/  \n\n-95- \n \nThe media and entertainment sector \nThe GRI’s sector-specific guidance provides exhaustive indicators and broad coverage of \nthe companies to which it may apply, which is not limited to media firms (in the broadest \nsense, including the cinema industry, for instance) and also caters for advertising and \npublic relations agencies, and social media. The sector-specific indicators are all qualitative \nand cover protecting fundamental rights, fostering pluralism and diversity, and respecting \njournalistic ethics (especially the confidentiality of sources and privacy).  \n \nThe GRI issued a Media Sector Supplement in 2012, which was reorganised in light of the \npublication of revised standards in December 2016.  \n \nBesides the required General Standard Disclosures (i.e. strategy and analysis, organizational \nprofile, identified material aspects and boundaries, stakeholder engagement, report profile; \ngovernance, ethics and integrity), the GRI requires the sector to report on economic, \nenvironmental and social categories:  \n \nBesides the common indicators which also apply to the oil and gas industry – which \nnevertheless have different metrics – the GRI has identified nine indicators which are \nspecific to the media sector in the social category – on the basis of a solely qualitative \napproach. These are: \n \n Protection of the freedom of expression. The chosen approach is qualitative with the goal \nbeing to comprehensively describe the factoring of freedom of expression into the \nmanagement of the media in question to comply with Article 19 of the Universal \nDeclaration on Human Rights: \n \n− Principles by which the organisation operates in the context of restrictions on freedom \nof expression; \n− Enabling companies to actively exercise their right to freedom of expression (e.g. \ntelecommunications technology/infrastructure, literacy programs, accessibility to \ncontent and services); \n− Pluralism of ideas and views; \n− Transparency regarding public policy and lobbying; \n− Principles to avoid self-censorship;  \n− Right of rectification and of reply; and \n− Audience interaction. \nThe chosen sub-indicators are fairly generic and are more geared towards large media \norganisations or social media.  \n The portrayal of human rights, in particular those of “minorities” (i.e. women, children, \npeople with disabilities, indigenous communities, religious and ethnic groups, other social \ngroups). The guidance emphasises the transparency of management’s approach to the \nrepresentation of minorities in media content and to the measures rolled out to ensure the \nabsence of any content inciting hatred (i.e. absence of discriminatory content, absence of \nunnecessary references to people’s physical characteristics, cultural practices or religious \nbeliefs); \n \n Protection of cultural rights; \n \n\n-96- \n \n Protection of intellectual property – on the basis of a qualitative approach (i.e. \nacknowledging and protecting copyright in all disseminated content); \n \n Protection of privacy (i.e. individuals referred to in disseminated content, confidentiality \nof sources, non-violation of privacy during news gathering, protecting sources’ privacy); \n \n Content creation (i.e. editorial independence, content quality, plurality and diversity); \n \n Content dissemination (accessibility and protection of vulnerable audiences); \n \n Audience interaction (users’ privacy, child/youth protection, personal identification, etc.); \nand \n \n Media literacy. \nThe SASB industry standard is characterised by the concentration of indicators compared \nto the GRI and by an approach that combines qualitative and quantitative metrics on \nindicators which are specific to the media and entertainment sector (similar to those of the \nGRI, excluding the sector’s economic and environmental issues which have non-negligible \nfinancial materiality).  \n \nLike its GRI equivalent, the standard established by the SASB for the media and \nentertainment sector in October 2018 covers a wide range of stakeholders extending beyond \npaper, radio, television and digital media. However, the SASB does specify that a special \nInternet, Media & Services Industry standard applies to media companies specialising in \nInternet content, in particular, social media. Stakeholder consultation on the standards began \nin 2012 and there were several phases of dialogue, the last of which took place in early 2018 \n(prior to publication of the standards in October 2018).  \n \nThe SASB requires publication of three key indicators: \n Protection of media pluralism: \n \n− The percentage of gender and racial/ethnic group representation for executives, for \nprofessionals and for all others. It should be noted that collecting “racial” data, which \nhas been common practice in the US since the end of the 18th century, is banned in \nFrance. For instance, public statistics bodies do not ask the citizens polled to place \nthemselves on a list of racial or ethnic groups but to provide basic information \npertaining to their civil status. As it stands, such a metric does not appear to be able to \nbe used in France;85 \n− A description of the approach to ensuring pluralism in news media content. \n \n Protection of journalistic integrity and sponsorship identification, comprising: \n \n− The amount of legal and regulatory fines and settlements associated with libel or \nslander \n− Revenues from embedded advertising; and  \n                                                           \n85 Status in Europe is more various as some countries authorize compilation of this type of data.  \n \n\n-97- \n \n− A description of the approach to assuring journalistic integrity (truthfulness and \nexhaustiveness of information, independence of content, protection of privacy)  \n \n Protection of intellectual property and anti-hacking measures (descriptive approach)  \nAs a result of having these three social and societal indicators, the SASB therefore \nexcludes the publication of economic (for instance, the GRI requires the disclosure of \nsubsidies received by the government and NGOs, as well as investments needed in \ninfrastructure and advertising) and environmental (for instance, the GRI requires disclosure \nof volumes of materials consumed and the implementation of a recycling policy for materials \nand energy savings) indicators. \nThe media’s environmental impact, bearing in mind the consumption of resources during the \npaper manufacturing and shipping stages, and also during the recycling of materials, is \nnevertheless one of the key challenges currently facing the sector. Similarly, the resilience of \nthe business models of many media companies as part of the expansion of digitalisation also \nseems to be a crucial issue. Such indicators contain certain financial materiality against a \nbackdrop of environmental and digital transitions.  \n \nBy focusing on the issues of media pluralism and journalistic integrity, the SASB standard is \ntherefore grounded in ESG considerations which, whilst being crucial for investors, (i.e.  \nmaintaining trust in the media and protection of the freedom of expression; ethics in the press \nand protection of intellectual property) nevertheless exclude major environmental86 and \neconomic issues (including for investors), as flagged up in a report published by Eurosif in \n2012.87  \n \nThe food processing sector \nThe food processing sector harbours major transparency issues due to growing societal \nexpectation on production processes, the industry’s environmental impacts and the rollout of \nresponsible agricultural and industrial practices as witnessed by the increasing number of \ncharters and certification procedures in this sector. In addition, the sector is characterised by \nthe fragmentation of its value chain at international level through the relative integration of \nlocal sectors, the expansion of brands and products in developed countries and the supply of \nraw materials and assembly in developing countries. The value chain takes in a broad range of \ncompanies (suppliers of agricultural machines and seed, chemicals, animal health tests, \npackaging, producers, distribution companies, etc.). Lastly, the increasing influence of \ndistribution firms means that negotiating powers are sliding towards the downstream part of \nthe sector. \n \nIn light of the foregoing, it seems pertinent to carry out a comparison of the GRI and SASB \nstandards for the food processing sector with an eye to understanding the related transparency \nissues and the possible differences in terms of the sector’s environmental, social and societal \npriorities. \n \n                                                           \n86 It should nevertheless be noted that the Internet Media and Services Industry standard contains more indicators \nand, most importantly, the environmental footprint of hardware infrastructure (i.e. energy and water \nconsumption, integration of environmental considerations to strategic planning for data center needs). \n87 Eurosif, Media Sector Report, June 2012. Available online: http://www.eurosif.org/media-sector-report-2012/  \n\n-98- \n \nOnce again, the GRI’s sector-specific guidance seeks to be exhaustive by covering issues \nconcerning health, environmental and social impacts of the value chain, and working \nconditions along the supply chain – whilst ignoring a number of key issues surrounding the \nsector’s environmental issues (water, energy, recycling packaging) and opting for an \nessentially qualitative based approach.  \n \nThe GRI issued a Food Processing Sector Supplement in 2010, which was reorganised in light \nof the publication of revised standards in December 2016.  \n \nBesides the required General Standard Disclosures (i.e. strategy and analysis, organizational \nprofile, identified material aspects and boundaries, stakeholder engagement, report profile, \ngovernance, ethics and integrity), the GRI requires the sector to report on economic, \nenvironmental and social categories. Apart from the indicators which are in common with the \ntwo previously studied sectors, by tabling different metrics, the GRI has identified two \nspecific indicators: programmes to promote nutritious and affordable food, and a detailed \ndescription of policies to ensure animal welfare throughout the value chain.  \n \nThe GRI’s guidance therefore has the following three strands:  \n \n Economic indicators, broken down as follows: \n \n− Direct economic value generated and distributed, with a metric on the programmes \nrolled out to promote healthy lifestyles for consumers and a metric on government \nassistance during the production stage (owing to both positive consequences, \nregarding the promotion of responsible practices and economic development, and \nnegative ones, due to the possible marginalisation of smaller-scale producers and \npotential negative consequences for public health which may be caused by such \nassistance); and \n− The sourcing strategy throughout the value chain on a range of aspects (protecting \nnatural resources, minimising toxicity, fair trade, fair compensation for labour, \ntraceability, presence of genetically modified organisms, animal welfare, etc.), \nfollowing international standards in this respect.  \n \n Environmental indicators, namely: \n \n− The identification of materials used; and \n− The number of operational sites owned, leased and managed in, or adjacent to, \nprotected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas, where the \nonus is placed on water restoration. \n \n Social and societal indicators which are of utmost importance due to the global value \nchains attached to the food processing industry:  \n \n− Labour/management relations, focusing on the implementation of social dialogue \nthroughout the value chain and the percentage of working time lost due to industrial \ndisputes, strikes and lock-outs, by country; \n− A description of any lobbying activities undertaken; \n− Programmes to promote nutritious and affordable food; \n\n-99- \n \n− A detailed description of policies to ensure animal welfare with specific quantitative \nmetrics; \n− Sub-indicators which are specific to production sites; to nutritional information on \nproducts and to communication about distribution practices; and   \n− More broadly, a description of major environmental and social impacts throughout the \nvalue chain. \n \nThe SASB industry standard is characterised by its environmental (energy, water, \npackaging lifecycle, sourcing) and societal (labelling and marketing, food safety issues) \nslant and excludes the social aspects of working conditions, and takes a mostly quantitative \napproach.  \n \nThe SASB requires the publication of eight key indicators: \n Energy management, namely operational energy consumption and its breakdown (i.e. grid \nelectricity, electricity from renewable energies); \n \n Water management, broken down as follows: total water withdrawn by source and the \npercentage of water consumed (by region, with the onus on water-stressed regions), the \nnumber of incidents of non-compliance with water regulations and a description of water \nmanagement risks; \n \n Food safety, based on the principles of the Global Food Safety Initiative88 and \ncertification by that body, together with an independent audit using a set of quantitative \ncriteria; \n \n Health and nutrition: revenue from products labelled and/or marketed to promote health \nand nutrition attributes, description of the process to identify and manage products of \nconcern for the health of consumers; \n \n Product labelling and marketing, focusing on quantitative data (i.e. advertising aimed at \nchildren, revenue from products labelled as containing genetically modified organisms \n(GMOs) and those labelled as non-GMO, non-conformance with regulatory labelling \nand/or marketing codes, and fines associated with legal proceedings); \n \n Packaging lifecycle management, including quantitative metrics concerning recycled \nmaterials and a description of strategies to reduce the environmental impact of packaging; \n \n Environmental and social impacts of ingredient supply chains (i.e. quantitative metrics \nconcerning the percentage of food ingredients sourced that are certified to third-party \nenvironmental and/or social standards, audit of suppliers based on standards of the same \nnature and non-conformance rate across the value chain); and \n                                                           \n88 The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) was set up in 2000 and works on a volunteer basis. It brings together \nkey actors in the food industry to collaboratively drive continuous improvement in food safety management \nsystems around the world, in particular in order to reduce food safety risks, audit duplication and costs while \nbuilding trust throughout the supply chain. Internationally, the GFSI has recognised a series of standards \nconcerning agriculture, agents and brokers, packaging materials, storage and distribution, etc. Since 2011, \nAmerican legislation has required heightened food safety audits and has encouraged an increasing number of \norganisations to consider the Global Food Safety Initiative as a compliance resource. https://www.sgsgroup.fr/fr-\nfr/agriculture-food/food/gfsi-certification  \n\n-100- \n \n \n Sourcing of ingredients, namely the percentage of ingredients sourced from water-stressed \nregions, a list of priority food ingredients and discussion of sourcing risks due to \nenvironmental and social considerations. \nThe GRI’s guidance and the SASB’s industry standard contain a large number of common \nindicators, in particular on issues concerning nutritional health, responsible marketing and \nlabelling, and sourcing risks. Nevertheless, these two frameworks diverge on a number of \naspects which are vital for the sector:  \nIn respect of the environment, the SASB ignores issues relating to raw materials and \nbiodiversity – while the GRI relies, without any special emphasis, on general standards for \ninformation on energy and water management. All these concerns contain certain financial \nmateriality in instances of water stress and energy transition. What is more, the SASB does \nnot address animal wellbeing.  \n \nNeither framework calls for transparency in waste management, nor the disclosure of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, in spite of the fact that this indicator is crucial in light of the \necological impact of major food processing firms.89 \n \n In the social field, the SASB does not address working conditions which are nevertheless \na major supply chain issue due to the risks of exploitative working conditions upstream in \nthe value chain, especially in developing countries. The rollout of preventive systems, \naudit procedures and appeal channels in the event of poor practices in the food processing \nsector are de rigueur in many countries; and \n \n To sum up, the SASB requires more granular information on factoring in environmental \nand social risks across the value chain, via quantitative metrics with a focus on sourcing \nrisks and aspects concerning energy and water management.   \n \nAccording to a white paper issued by the World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment (WBCSD) in 2017 on extra-financial reporting in the food and agriculture \nsector,90 the ESG issues which are the most published by the reporting companies (96 in all, \nsee table below) are GHG emissions, supply chain responsibility, energy and water \nmanagement, waste management, and health and food safety issues.  \nConversely to the corporate practices examined by the white paper, it should be noted that \nthere are no GHG emission indicators in the two frameworks and that the GRI does not \naddress waste management.  \n                                                           \n89 According to the FAO (World Agriculture towards 2030/2050, published in 2012) and McKinsey (Purchasing \nthe global opportunity in food and agribusiness, published in 2015), the food processing sector accounts for \naround 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  \n90 WBCSD, Materiality in corporate reporting: a White Paper focusing on the food and agriculture sector, 2017. \nAvailable online: https://docs.wbcsd.org/2017/form/WBCSD_Materiality_Report.PDF  \nIt should be noted that the table refers to the SASB’s provisional standards which were published prior to \nOctober 2018.  \n\n-101- \n \n \n \nCurrent development lessons from the sector-specific approach \nThe first thing to be noted is that, following their publication in November 2018, the SASB’s \nindustry standards represent a major aspect of this organisation as they extend to all economic \nactivity. For its part, the GRI has tended to only cover a dozen or so sectors although new \ndevelopments were announced in February 2019. However, the sector-specific guidance has \nonly ever been intended to be an addition to the general standards. This is a fundamental \ndifference which needs to be borne in mind when carrying out a comparison. \n \nIn light of the foregoing, and without drawing final conclusions regarding the sectors covered \nby the GRI and the SASB,91 the comparative study of the three chosen sectors (oil and gas, \nmedia and entertainment, and food processing) has brought to light significant differences in \nthe approach to corporate extra-financial reporting which can be summarised as follows: \n                                                           \n91 Extra-financial rating agencies, such as Vigeo Eiris, have conducted their own examinations of the materiality \nof the SASB’s industry standards: studying the Vigeo Eiris analysis and discussions with the task force have \nconfirmed a number of significant “materiality gaps” in many sectors (i.e. oil and gas, tobacco, etc.).  \n \n \n\n-102- \n \n \n The GRI’s sector-specific guidance, which is an addition to the general standards, has the \nfollowing features: \n \n− Comprehensive coverage of the required economic, environmental and social \ninformation: the indicators most frequently address all the ESG issues in a given \nsector, bearing in mind the fact that the “economic” category often represents the \ninterface between the company’s financial and societal challenges (for instance, \npayments to government, procurement practices, etc.); \n− The GRI’s relatively qualitative approach in respect of the indicators put forward has \nmore in common with the management report or the Management Discussion & \nAnalysis than with uniquely quantitative metrics. This is even more the case for social \nissues for which contextualisation and the identification of applicable regulations are \nvital. Obviously, this situation makes it harder to digitalise information; and \n− The wide range of indicators reflects the GRI’s multi-stakeholder approach, including \nin the “economic” category. This, in turn, creates a certain complexity. The GRI \nappears to be getting companies to “tell a story” based on the ESG issues connected to \ntheir business activity rather than ensuring that the indicators can be both measured \nand compared. This is especially true for the food processing sector, amongst the \nindustries studied, which stands out due to the exhaustiveness of the indicators and \ntheir broadly qualitative approach with regard to the proposed metrics, unlike the \nSASB which has a resolutely quantitative approach for this sector.  \n \n For their part, the SASB’s industry standards have the following features: \n \n− The scope of required information is narrower and focused on investors’ expectations, \nwith a “bias” due to the market consensus reached with an eye to publishing the \nstandards. In this respect, the example of the media and entertainment sector is telling \nwith the SASB only requiring the publication of ESG information on three key \nindicators in the societal category. On the other hand, the GRI takes a broader view \nand includes, for instance, the environmental issues concerning this sector. This \noversight of the scope of required information goes hand in hand with the positive fact \nthat the SASB’s standards are organised so as to be understandable and intelligible for \nthe targeted stakeholders, i.e. investors (the standards’ format fosters ease of use). \n− The SASB’s grounding in the proposed metrics is deliberately quantitative: for the \nthree sectors under review, the publication strategy is strongly geared towards \nquantitative metrics, which can therefore be measured and compared, even in fields, \nsuch as the social category, which remain subject to a qualitative approach. This \nstrategy, which carries the advantage of making reporting operational and ensuring \nintra-sector comparability, may be implemented at the expense of the necessary \ncontextualisation of the indicator (especially in the social and societal field) and of the \nregulations specific to each country (in this respect, the media and entertainment \nsector indicator on ethnic group representation for executives and professionals in a \ncompany is telling as this metric cannot be published by companies operating in \ncountries where “racial” statistics are banned); \n− However, quantitative metrics are often accompanied by qualitative ones enabling the \npublished figures to be illustrated; \n− The studied sectors give little room to GHG emissions and, where applicable, the onus \nis only on scope 1 emissions; and  \n\n-103- \n \n− The majority of legislative and regulatory references are American, with the exception \nof a number of references to international standards for certain sectors, (for instance, \nthe GHG Protocol and ILO principles). More broadly, there is often a “US-centric” \nprism in the selection of ESG indicators for each sector (as shown by references to \nhydraulic fracturing in the oil and gas industry)92. \n \n More generally, the two frameworks have two common denominators: \n \n− Neither seems totally exhaustive for the sectors under review. The different \napproaches and coverage reflect different targets as well as the complexity of a \nconsensus on the key environmental and social issues in a climate of transition; \n− The indicators and metrics laid down by both frameworks do not enable the relevant \ncompanies, at least in the oil and gas and food processing sectors, to easily position \nthemselves against a backdrop of transitions. Besides the indicators enabling the \ncompany’s strategy to be classified in respect of a given indicator (therefore remaining \nbroadly qualitative and hardly comparable), the scarcity of forward-looking indicators \nemphasises these frameworks’ lack of momentum in a context of environmental, \nsocial and digital transitions which are, nevertheless, of utmost importance.  \n                                                           \n92 As such, on 22 May 2019, SASB announced the expansion of the \"Investor Advisory Group\" made up of asset \nmanagers and owners, with the arrival of fifteen new members from Canada, France (AXA Investment \nManagement), Japan, Norway and the United Kingdom. Barbara Zvan (Strategy and Risk Manager for the \nOntario Teachers' Pension Plan) was appointed to lead this committee on 28 May 2019. \n\n-104- \n \n2.3 Climate-related standards have progressed significantly meaning \nthat an initial stage of standard convergence can be considered  \nClimate-related reporting (which covers all information on the climate scorecard and GHG \nemissions for a given structure) is far and away the most advanced form of reporting at \npresent, both in terms of metrics, framework and transparency principles, for businesses and \nfinancial stakeholders. This conclusion arises from the climate emergency and collective \nawareness over the past two decades, which has led to collective emulation and a large \nnumber of initiatives.  \nA key step in this direction was certainly Mark Carney’s speech in September 2015 on \n“Breaking the tragedy of the horizon – climate change and financial stability” when the \ncurrent Governor of the Bank of England and former Chairman of the Financial Stability \nBoard called for extra-financial information to be bolstered, in terms of both content and \npresentation, to support public policies and allow investors to assess the risks and \nopportunities created by climate change (with better knowledge of the issuer’s \ncircumstances). He also drew attention to the age of extra-financial information schemes and \ntheir (too great) diversity (“the existing surfeit of existing schemes and fragmented \ndisclosures means a risk of getting “lost in the right direction”). By advocating the \nestablishment of the TCFD, he ended his speech with the words: “By managing what gets \nmeasured, we can break the Tragedy of the Horizon”93. \nHere, we can differentiate between what is covered by reporting frameworks, which are \nbroadly principles-based, and by standards putting forward metrics for calculating GHG \nemissions. In this respect, a series of initiatives are also being developed to boost transparency \nconcerning the GHG emissions, and emission trajectories, of businesses and financial \nstakeholders.  \n \nThe vast majority of these initiatives were mentioned in the NFRD’s non-binding guidelines \nwhich were published in 2017 and which are subject to a detailed appendix (see appendix. 4).  \n \nThe “principles-based” frameworks of the CDSB and the TCFD are destined for \nbusinesses for the disclosure of climate-related information to inform decision-making \nby investors and therefore reallocate capital flows to protecting the environment  \nThe Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) was formed in 2007 at the annual \nmeeting of the World Economic Forum. It provides a climate change reporting framework \nthat seeks to filter out what is required (principle of materiality) to understand how climate \nchange affects a company’s financial performance.  \nThe CDSB stresses that it does not offer reporting indicators and metrics as it considers that it \nis more pertinent to rely on existing standards and guidance. Instead, it provides a \nframework composed of key reporting principles and requirements (i.e. governance, \nmanagement’s environmental policies, strategy and targets, explanation of the material \ncurrent and anticipated environmental risks and opportunities, material sources of \n                                                           \n93 On 21 March 2019, Mark Carney in his speech “A New Horizon”, declared after a feedback of the \nimplementation status of the TCFD recommendations: “The momentum behind the TCFD’s voluntary disclosure \nis creating a virtuous circle by encouraging learning by doing. As companies apply the recommendations and \ninvestors increasingly differentiate between firms based on this information, adoption will continue to spread, \ndisclosure will become more decision-useful and efficient, and its impact will grow”. \n\n-105- \n \nenvironmental impact, performance and comparative analysis, the effect of environmental \nimpacts on the organisation’s future performance, consistent use of indicators and metrics as \npart of reporting, reporting on an annual basis, etc.), covering natural capital and climate \nchange.   \n \nThe CDSB published its first reporting framework in 2010, before revising it in 2013 (by \nexpanding the scope beyond GHG emissions) and again in 2015, putting forward a reporting \nstrategy including environmental information connected with natural capital (i.e. air, water, \nland, minerals, forests, biodiversity and ecosystem health) and climate change (i.e. GHG \nemissions). In April 2018, the CDSB brought its framework into line with the TCFD’s \nrecommendations.   \n \nToday, the CDSB’s reporting framework is based on the following set of core references:  \n \ni. \nThe TCFD recommendations; \n \nii. \nThe IASB’s standards and principles and the IFRS’ Management Commentary – by \nadapting their qualitative characteristics to transparency in environmental matters and by \nusing the main principles for the materiality of information94; \n \niii. \nNational legislative and/or regulatory arrangements (such as Article 173 of the French \nEnergy Transition and Green Growth Act or the SEC’s 2010 Commission Guidance \nRegarding Disclosure Relating to Climate Change); \n \niv. \nThe sector-specific guidance published domestically by many countries, such as the \nenvironmental reporting guidelines issued by the Department for Environment, Food and \nRural Affairs in the UK in 2013; \n \nv. \nInternational standards in which mention is made of the GRI, the IIRC, the ISO, the \nOECD, the PRI and the UN Global Compact; and \n \nvi. \nThe work of CDSB Board members (SASB, WBCSD, Ceres, World Resources \nInstitute). \n \n \n                                                           \n94 The proximity of the CDSB with IFRS should be noted and this was flagged up by people interviewed by the \ntask force. In addition, in March 2018, the CDSB published a guide called “Uncharted waters: how can \ncompanies use financial accounting standards to deliver on the TCFD’s recommendations?” which sought to \npinpoint the financial reporting standards which could help companies comply with the TCFD’s \nrecommendations.  \n\n-106- \n \nThe framework, which was revamped in 2018, provides for a better match between the \nCDSB’s guiding principles and reporting requirements and the TCFD’s recommendations, in \nparticular regarding information to be provided, as set out in the table below:  \n \n \nSource: CDSB & SASB, Getting started on TCFD implementation, published on 1 May 2019  \n \nAs described in Section 1.5, the TCFD (whose work was initiated in December 2015, under \nthe umbrella of the Financial Stability Board and chaired by Michael Bloomberg) was asked \nwith drawing up principles, in order to apply to both financial and non-financial sectors, \nregarding the disclosure of climate-related extra-financial information, in respect of risks and \nopportunities. Against a backdrop of growing physical risks and transition related to climate \nchange, heightened transparency enables investors to assess the climate change-related risks \nand opportunities for their capital allocations decisions and to prioritise the long-term in their \ninvestment decisions.  \n \nThe TCFD’s recommendations specify the climate reporting information in companies’ \nreference documents in four key areas (i.e. governance, strategy, risk management, metrics \nand targets), within a broader perspective than simply publishing the company’s carbon \nfootprint.   \n\n-107- \n \nConsequently: \n As regards governance, companies should describe the board’s oversight of climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities and management’s role in assessing and managing those \nrisks and opportunities;  \n \n As regards strategy, companies should describe the climate-related risks and opportunities \nthe company has identified over the short, medium and long term, the impact of those \nrisks and opportunities on the company’s businesses, strategy and financial planning and \nthe resilience of the company’s strategy taking into consideration different climate-related \nscenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario; \n \n As regards risk management, companies should describe their processes for identifying \nand assessing climate-related risks, the processes for managing those risks and how they \nare integrated into the company’s overall risk management; \n \n As regards metrics and targets, companies should disclose the metrics and targets used to \nmeasure and quantify climate-related risks and opportunities, disclose scope 1, scope 2, \nand, if appropriate scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and the related risks, and describe \nthe targets used by the company to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and \nperformance against targets.  \n \nThe TCFD also recommends using scenario analysis to assess the degree of robustness of \norganisations in the face of climate change. Lastly, for non-financial industries and, in \nparticular the energy, agriculture, food and forest products, transportation, and materials and \nbuildings sectors, the TCFD has developed supplemental guidance (i.e. integration of climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities into decision-making and strategy formulation matrices (R&D, \nadoption of new technologies, investments, restructuring, depreciation or deterioration of \nassets, etc.).  \n \nTo date, around 625 companies and organisations (representing market capitalisation of \nalmost USD seven trillion), including 340 financial institutions which manage assets of more \nthan USD 107 trillion, have expressed support for the TCFD’s work95 – alongside a \nnumber of governments (France, Belgium, Sweden, UK) and financial regulators (Australia, \nBelgium, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, UK). \nThe TCFD’s 2018 Status Report, which was published in September 2018, aims to promote \nadoption of its recommendations by financial and non-financial companies (See Status Report \nSummary in appendix no. 7).  \n \nIn its action plan on sustainable finance (see section 1.3), the European Commission sought to \nimprove the transparency of information published by companies. To this end, it revised its \nguidelines on non-financial reporting to make them compatible with the TCFD’s \nrecommendations.  \n \nFor instance, the TCFD has spurred a large number of private initiatives, including the \nflagship Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), with an eye to fostering fulfilment of the \nTCFD’s recommendations and bringing investment decisions into line with the goals of the \n                                                           \n95 According to information gathered by the task force from the TCFD Secretariat in early May 2019. This \nnumber is expected to increase in the coming months, taking into account the commitment of Japanese \ncompanies, for example, and the announcements that will be made at the G20 Osaka Summit (28-29 June 2019). \n\n-108- \n \nParis Agreement. The TPI was launched in January 2017 as a joint initiative between the \nChurch of England National Investing Bodies (Church of England Pensions Board, the \nChurch Commissioners and CBF Funds) and the British Environment Agency Pension Fund, \nwith support from FTSE Russell, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the \nEnvironment, the London School of Economics and the Principles for Responsible \nInvestment.   It is now led and supported by a large number of asset owners and asset \nmanagers, representing an aggregate total of over GBP 2,000 billion. The TPI enables \ninvestors to evaluate the quality of companies’ management of their GHG emissions, to \nevaluate how companies’ planned or expected future carbon performance compares to \ninternational targets and national pledges made as part of the Paris Agreement, and to publish \nthis information online through a publicly-available resource. Stakeholders can therefore use \nthe TPI to inform their investment research, their investment decisions, the measures taken to \ncomply with their commitments and decisions regarding the exercising of voting rights. \n \nAs their approach is broadly similar, being focused on the financial materiality of climate \nchange-related risks and opportunities, the CDSB and the SASB have been working \ntogether since 2017 on their joint alignment with the TCFD. The task force was able to \nconsult their “TCFD Implementation Guide” which was published on 1 May 2019. The \nguide is for companies looking to implement the TCFD’s guidelines as effectively as possible.  \n \nPart II of the TCFD Implementation Guide (“Getting Started”) first puts forwards a series of \nrecommendations in order to, initially, integrate climate assessment, monitoring and \nmanagement into companies’ routine business activities then, subsequently, to publish \ninformation which is transparent, significant and relevant for stakeholders, who are, first and \nforemost, the investors. The cornerstone for implementation is to secure the support of the \nboard of directors and executive leadership for assessment and reporting initiatives, as shown \nby the following diagram taken from the guide: \n \nSource: CDSB & SASB, TCFD Implementation Guide, Part II: Getting Started, published in 1 May \n2019 \n \nBy highlighting core practical examples, the guide then allows for implementation of the \nTCFD’s recommendations by applying the principles, indicators and metrics of the CDSB and \nthe SASB – by emphasising the fully complementary nature of the three approaches.   \n\n-109- \n \nA number of current initiatives are geared towards providing a specific reporting \nframework for greenhouse gas emissions and precise metrics to provide heightened \ntransparency for companies’ decarbonisation strategies \nBy way of introduction, it should be noted that it is not easy to measure the transition risks \nand opportunities connected with shifting the economy towards a low-carbon model. We need \nto distinguish between:  \n \n Measurement of the carbon footprint to assess a company’s impact in terms of GHG \nemissions and its dependency on emissions (i.e. the emissions required for a given \ncompany’s business activity throughout its value chain). This involves dividing emissions \nreleased into the air into “scopes” (i.e. on one hand, scopes 1 & 2 for direct and indirect \nemissions relating to a company’s energy consumption, for which the company has \nsignificant responsibility as it is able to implement direct leverage actions; and scope 3 for \nall emissions upstream and downstream of the company’s value chain – a scope which is \nvital but complicated as the company very often shares responsibility with other \nstakeholders96) \n \n Measurement of avoided emissions – enabling a company’s contribution to overall \nemission reduction to be objectivised (via the generated climate benefits) – originating \nfrom actions outside the above-mentioned scopes 1, 2 and 3; and \n \n Measurement of a company’s decarbonisation strategy – a field in which the TCFD \nprovides useful references (in particular, as regards climate-related opportunities, as set \nout in page 11 of the Final Report published in 2017).  \n \nIn this respect, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is a not-for-profit charity which runs the \nglobal disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage \ntheir environmental impacts. The CDP currently gathers together around 525 investors, \naccounting for almost USD 96 billion in managed assets in 2018. Over 7,000 companies and \nmore than 600 towns and cities replied to its questionnaires on climate change, water, forests \nand the supply chain in 2018; as a result, in 2018, 120 states and regions were able to measure \ntheir environmental impact.   \n \nSince 2003, the CDP has been running an annual campaign, using a questionnaire, in order to \ncompile information on companies’ GHG emissions (including in the oil and gas industry \nsince 2010). The CDP has gradually widened its scope by issuing annual reports on water \nmanagement (Global Water Report) and on impacts on forests (Global Forests Report). \n \nThe CDP’s questionnaires are comprehensive and highly specific, and enable companies to \ndisclose information on their activities in a wide range of sectors: \n \n In respect of climate-related risks and opportunities:  \n \n− Describe the governance mechanisms into which climate-related issues are integrated  \n                                                           \n96 The breakdown into scopes was instigated by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, in close collaboration with the \nWDCSB (see appendix no. 8). Available online: \nhttps://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards_supporting/FAQ.pdf  \n\n-110- \n \n− Risks (by type: current and emerging regulation, technology, legal, market, \nreputational, physical, upstream and downstream in the value chain) and climate-\nchange related opportunities in the short, medium and long term  \n− The management processes and associated reporting mechanism within the company \n(at the level of the company and its assets)  \n− Where and how the impact of the risks and opportunities on the company’s businesses \nhave been factored into the financial planning process   \n− The integration of climate-related issues into the business strategy; and \n− Emissions targets and the associated performance – and information on emissions \nreductions initiatives and low emission goods and services, together with emissions \ndata for the three scopes \n \n Additional metrics (energy consumption, waste management, emissions of gases other \nthan GHGs, oil reserves, etc.)  \n \n The company’s status in respect of third party verification/assurance of its GHG emissions \nby scope and location  \n \n The carbon pricing systems used by the company; and  \n \n The company’s engagement across the value chain with policy makers and within trade \nassociations on climate change-related issues  \n \nIn addition, two French initiatives should be mentioned due to their commitment to climate-\nrelated reporting vis-à-vis companies and their goal of building methodologies for the \neffective implementation of the energy transition:  \n \nThe Assessing Low Carbon Transition (ACT) Initiative  \n \nThis joint ADEME/CDP initiative aims to bolster climate-related reporting practices and to \nidentify which companies are actually shifting to a low-carbon model and which have made \nsignificant progress, irrespective of their size or markets. The ACT Initiative’s approach is \ntherefore resolutely holistic and proactive by assessing and forecasting the relevant \ncompany’s low-carbon trajectory. The Initiative is characterised by its assessment and \nranking mechanism which allow independent information to be provided on the alignment of \ncompanies’ strategies and their climate-based performance in relation to sectoral \ndecarbonisation approaches,  to provide them  with explanations of these sectoral approaches \nso as to forestall the related transition risks (with an eye to including the scenarios set out by \nthe National Low-Carbon Strategy) and therefore to enable them to disclose relevant \ninformation vis-à-vis the TCFD’s recommendations.  \n \nThe first pilot stage of the ACT project took place internationally in 2016, involving 24 \ncompanies across three sectors (electric utilities, auto manufacturing and retail) and, in 2017, \nwith French SMEs/mid-tier companies so as to adjust incumbent methodologies to match the \nissues faced by smaller companies. By 2021, the goal of the ACT Initiative is to extend to all \nthe economy’s non-financial sectors, in particular oil and gas, cement and transportation. The \nADEME advised the task force that the ACT method is used in different manners as mature \nbusinesses use it to assess their climate strategies whereas, for SMEs/mid-tier companies, the \nInitiative helps structure their approaches.   \n\n-111- \n \nIt should also be mentioned that, with the ACT Initiative, the ADEME and CDP are taking \npart in the work of the World Benchmarking Alliance to build a Corporate Climate Action \nBenchmark to help achieve SDG 13 on climate action. This demonstrates the ADEME’s \ndetermination to disseminate the ACT method internationally to bolster companies’ climate-\nrelated reporting by acting as an instrument to steer their gradual decarbonisation. In addition, \nthe AENETA project, designed to activate a European ACT network, began in April 2018 and \nincludes a series of work areas over three years, including the development of sectoral \nmethods and associated assessment tools in order to cover the main non-financial sectors \ntargeted by the TCFD and the assessment of hundreds of European and international \ncompanies. \nThe Net Zero Initiative  \n \nThis second initiative, which was unveiled in September 2018 by the consulting firm, \nCarbone 4, aims to define and encourage corporate carbon neutrality, in consultation with \nmajor firms (including Engie, L’Oréal, the RATP, EDF, Havas, the BPCE Group and Orange) \nand an independent scientific committee. The impetus for the Initiative was the difficulty in \ncomparing companies’ carbon neutrality declarations for which the boundaries are often \nimprecise and arbitrary.   \n \nThe Net Zero Initiative therefore aims to ensure consistency and interaction between existing \nconcepts and methods (Science Based Targets, a joint initiative of the UN Global Compact, \nthe WWF, the World Resources Institute and the CDP, which was launched in 2015 and \nwhich is striving to match GHG emission reduction objectives, by sector, with climate science \ndata, the above-mentioned ACT method, avoided emissions methodology, etc.) To this end, \nthe Initiative is heading towards “a pathway and not a factual situation” by making companies \ncommit to a transformation process, using harmonised indicators for actual emission \nreduction (i.e. reduction of emissions on scopes 1, 2 and 3 – or induced emissions; and \nreduction of emissions outside the company’s scope – or avoided emissions) and become \ninvolved in increasing global CO2 sinks (i.e. development of sequestration and storage – or \nnegative emissions). The Net Zero Initiative also intends to measure all emissions via triple \nentry carbon accounting: induced emissions, avoided emissions and negative emissions.  \n \nIt is therefore clear that corporate climate-related reporting has progressed although a \nnumber of caveats remain (i.e. going beyond “ordinary” reporting on scopes 1, 2 and 3 to \nachieve carbon neutrality, rolling out a holistic and forward-looking approach to greenhouse \ngas emissions to join a decarbonisation trajectory), which two French initiatives, the ACT \nInitiative and the Net Zero Initiative, are attempting to address, by working together with \nthe private sector and academia.   \n\n-112- \n \n2.4 Theme-based frameworks other than those relating to the climate \nare often general or specific and cannot yet be considered mature \nstandards   \nTheme-based frameworks concerning the environment, other than those relating to the \nclimate  \nEnvironmental reporting, which goes beyond climate change-related reporting as such, is less \nextensive owing to scientific and technical (i.e. current problems with measuring the loss of \nbiodiversity, the entire natural capital, etc.) and political (collective awareness of the \ndeterioration of ecosystems and the massive loss of biodiversity manifested itself later than \nfor global warming) considerations.  \n \nConsequently, unlike the corporate climate impact methodologies that led to the TCFD being \nset up, risk analysis relating to the loss of biodiversity cannot yet rely on standardised data \nand methodologies. There is no homogenised, or more broadly, accepted data which could \nenable companies and financial institutions to measure and disclose the impacts of their assets \nportfolio or businesses on biodiversity, to assess the related risks and opportunities and alter \ntheir practices.97  \n \nThere are however a number of initiatives which, at present, have not been fully developed \nand coordinated: \n \nThe Eco-Management and Audit Scheme Regulation   \n \nThe EMAS Regulation is an EU regulation98 on the voluntary participation by organisations \nin a Community eco-management and audit scheme. Although it is not a reporting framework \nas such, its content is governed by the process for certifying the environmental statement. \nMoreover, this regulation is one of the frameworks mentioned in the recommendations of the \nNon-Financial Reporting Directive.  \n \nThe environmental statement must disclose the entity’s environmental policy, the scope for \nenvironmental progress and describe the environmental management system. In addition it \nmust contain a clear assessment of the environmental problems and issues relating to \nactivities, a quantified summary of pollutant emissions, waste production, consumption of raw \nmaterials, energy, water and, where applicable, an analysis of other major environmental \naspects, a list of other factors and indicators that characterise environmental results, an \noverview of the environmental management policy, programme and system. \n \nThe Natural Capital Protocol \n \nAs already mentioned in section 1.5, the Natural Capital Protocol provides a forum for \ndiscussions on natural capital by striving to include existing standards without offering a \nspecific reporting framework. Its goal is to build standardised methodology to ensure better \nunderstanding and quantification of companies’ impacts and dependencies vis-à-vis \n                                                           \n97 This is why, in early 2019, the Minster for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition commissioned a joint WWF \n/AXA task force to work on rolling out global biodiversity assessment measures, in the run up to the G7 \nEnvironment Meeting in May 2019 (report published on 6 May 2019).  \n98 Regulation (EC) No 761/2001, revised in 2002 and 2004.  \n\n-113- \n \necosystems. The Natural Capital Coalition will submit a report to the European Commission \nin the summer of 2019. \n \nThe Carbon Disclosure Standard Board \n \nIn 2013, CDSB, as described above, expanded the scope of its framework beyond GHG \nemissions to encompass all natural capital. \n \nThe European Commission’s Business@Biodiversity Platform  \n \nThe Platform was set up in 2010 to help companies understand, quantify and reduce their \nimpacts on biodiversity. In conjunction with the work of the Natural Capital Protocol, the \nPlatform identifies initiatives for the implementation of accounting indicators and/or \nproposals.    \n \nThe Global Biodiversity Score \n \nIn 2015, in France, the Deposits and Consignments Fund (Caisse des dépôts et consignations) \nbiodiversity economy task force began looking at how to build biodiversity footprint \nmethodology99 for companies across all economic sectors with the dual goal of maintaining \nthe cross-cutting approach specific to ecosystem services whilst focusing the analysis on the \nsubject of biodiversity100. \n \nAs biodiversity-related issues are so vast, the work is still ongoing at both European and \ninternational levels.  \n \nSocial and human capital-related frameworks \nAs human and social aspects are central to the issues faced by economic stakeholders, a \nnumber of non-profit organisations and NGOs have attempted to come up with a better \ndefinition of this field and of the resulting indicators. \n \nThe scope of human capital extends to all aspects relating to employees of a company or an \norganisation (i.e. their skillsets, capacity to innovate, motivation, loyalty to their employer, \netc.) whereas that of social/relationship capital (taking the English meaning of the world \n“social”) covers all the social relationships forged by companies. This is a huge field taking in \ncustomer/supplier relations, the application of labour law and human rights to its own \nemployees as well as those of its suppliers and subcontractors, poverty and modern slavery. \nDue to this very broad scope, social/relationship capital is one of the hardest to measure and \nthere are no specific international indicator standards but simply principles and frameworks \nthat structure the approach to responsibility.     \nIn this respect, the UN Guiding Principles101 lay the foundations for corporate social \nresponsibility. They were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011 and represent \nthe benchmark principles on business and human rights. They implement the UN’s “Protect, \n                                                           \n99 http://www.mission-economie-biodiversite.com/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2017/12/N11-TRAVAUX-\nDU-CLUB-B4B-INDICATEUR-GBS-FR-BD.pdf  \n100 CDC Biodiversité (2017). Vers une évaluation de l’empreinte biodiversité des entreprises : le Global \nBiodiversity Score. Les cahiers de Biodiv’2050 : Club B4B+. Mission économie de la biodiversité, n°11 \n101https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/un-guiding-principles   \n\n-114- \n \nRespect and Remedy” Framework. Whilst confirming states’ existing obligations to respect, \nprotect and fulfil human rights, these Guiding Principles recognise the requirement for \ncompanies to also respect them, by introducing a principle of due diligence.  \n \nAll companies, regardless of their size, must identify, prevent and mitigate any violations of \nhuman rights, and account for how they address adverse impacts. Where applicable, \ncompanies must compensate victims of human rights harms, or contribute to compensation \nmechanisms. The human rights obligations are binding on companies for their own business \nactivities and also for the activities of their subsidiaries or their entire sphere of influence such \nas, for instance, suppliers or subcontractors. This extends companies’ responsibility to \nwherever they may operate. These Guiding Principles provide a behavioural standard for \ncompanies’ responsible attitudes but do not, under any circumstances, represent a reporting \nframework with indicators.    \nIn February 2019, the WBCSD,102 a Geneva-based organisation of around 200 leading \nbusinesses and partners, published the Human & Social Capital Protocol103 along the lines of \nthe Natural Capital Protocol. Based on the assumption that employee well-being is central to \nthe good running of company activities, the goal is to provide a strategic discussion \nframework taking in all aspects of human and social capital. The Protocol, which draws on \nmore than twenty company case studies and feedback from an extensive public consultation, \ndescribes in four major stages the process for companies to identify this capital, to identify the \nrelevant indicators, their measurement and design, and the implementation of action plans. \nThe idea is to put forward an action-oriented and harmonised approach. The Protocol does not \nprovide specific indicators as such and each organisation has to identify the indicators which \nare the most appropriate for its purposes. \n \nShareAction’s Workforce Disclosure Initiative104 (WDI) also deserves a mention. It focuses \nexclusively on human capital and the working conditions for companies’ employees and for \ntheir supply chain. The Initiative was unveiled in 2017 by a UK-based NGO which advocates \nheightened transparency and responsible investment and has been backed by investors (120 \nsignatories). It was based on the fact that, previously, workforce reporting was not sufficiently \nmeaningful and comparable. 2017 was a pilot year and 90 companies disclosed their data \nbased on a series of questions established by the WDI in 2018. WDI methodology is set out in \nits 2018 Guidance Document105 which contains the rationale for the issue at hand (Why this is \nimportant), the guiding principles and the relevant questions that need to be asked to establish \nthis reporting by structuring it around topics and, where necessary, mentioning potential \nreferences to other frameworks (GRI, UN, etc.) The selected topics are governance, \nassessment of risks and opportunities relating to the workforce, workforce composition and \nwage levels, employee turnover, training, occupational health and well-being, labour law, the \nsupply chain and the strategy as regards subcontracting and impacts on the workforce. \n \nThe WDI therefore offers an explanatory approach to human issues which unify existing \napproaches. Disclosure is on a voluntary basis and the data collected is made available online \nand free-of-charge. The WDI is set to continue working in this area with an eye to offering \ncompanies examples of best practices and case studies in 2020. \n                                                           \n102 World Business Council on Sustainable Development. \n103https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Redefining-Value/Business-Decision-Making/Measurement-\nValuation/Social-Human-Capital-Protocol \n104 https://shareaction.org/wdi/  \n105 https://shareaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/WDI_Survey_Guidance_2018.pdf \n \n\n-115- \n \n \nUp until now, the general approach chosen for human and social/societal aspects has been to \noffer tools to structure approaches by defining general behavioural principles. There is no \nsocial indicators framework as such and companies are therefore obliged to select what they \nconsider to be the most appropriate indicators from among those set out in their countries’ \nlegislation or in more general frameworks such as those of the GRI or the SASB (see section \n2.1). \n \nEven for so-called simple indicators such as the workforce, the definitions are not precise \nenough. This can cause inconsistent implementation and therefore give rise to information \nwhich is not directly comparable. For instance, there are possible divergences on indicators \nused for: \n The date to be used to count the workforce (presence at the start or end of the month, \ncalculation of an average) \n \n Employment contracts to be taken into account: open-ended contracts (full or part time?), \nfixed-term contracts, apprenticeship contracts, interns; and  \n \n Taking account of sick leave and maternity leave   \n \nTheme-based frameworks concerning governance  \nGovernance-related principles are not set out as such in a framework. However, Directive \n2013/34/EU provides in its Article 20 that relevant undertakings “shall include a corporate \ngovernance statement in their management report” and that this statement must make \nreference to the corporate governance code to which the undertaking is subject. \n \nIn France, the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies, which is published by the \nAfep/Medef, was updated in 2018 to explicitly include environmental and social issues. In its \nArticle 1.1, the Code stipulates that the board “[…] shall promote long-term corporate value \ncreation by taking account of the social and environmental issues attached to the \ncompany’s activities. Where applicable, it shall table any changes to the articles of \nassociation which it may consider necessary”. As a result, social and environmental \nconsiderations have become a definitive feature of companies’ daily concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n-116- \n \n2.5 General reference frameworks oriented towards intangibles are \nlimited and essentially cover qualitative information \n \nA number of stakeholders, often from academia and from management and strategy \nconsulting firms, have decided to focus on intangibles from a positive standpoint (by \nintroducing the notion of intellectual capital) and on their contribution to value creation. \nThese include, purely as an illustration in view of the abundant documentation (especially \nacademic with a strategic view, see section 1.2 above) on the subject, the WICI (World \nIntellectual Capital/Assets Initiative) network, the Intangibles Monitoring Centre in France \nand the IIRC. \n \nTools for self-awareness, awareness raising and training on the concept of intangibles \ncontributing to the creation of value in companies have been implemented. Until recently, \ndiscussions concerning intangible / intellectual capital were often almost exclusively focused \non the accounting issues of R&D expenses and their capitalisation, whether authorised or not \nby accounting standards. Although non-capitalised R&D expenditure is part of a company’s \nintangible value, it is only one item amongst many others. It is most common to define \nintangible capital as comprising the following three asset categories: \n Human capital: includes all tacit or implicit knowledge, talents, experiences and know-\nhow of employees;  \n \n Structural capital : includes organizational routines, procedures, work methods, \ninformation systems, databases, technology and research and development; \n \n Relational capital: includes everything that links the company to its environment \n(shareholders, partners, customers, suppliers, etc.).  \nAs these items are, by their very nature, specific to each company according to its \nbackground, environment and strategy, and as they are hard to quantify and measure, the \nbenchmark standards or frameworks are still highly indicative or generic and are largely given \nover to descriptions and explanations. \n \nThis is why, as a rule, these frameworks are not generally widely-used as benchmarks. \nStandardisation procedures for extra-financial information focus more on risks than on \nopportunities. At least, broadly speaking, companies are able to decide on the development of \ninformation on the “opportunities dimension” and can therefore freely refer to the factors of \nsuccess that justify the “wealth” that accounting information does not express, and to the \noutlook in terms of changes.   \n \nThe task force considers that this segment of extra-financial information could warrant \nincreased development of standards. \n \n \n\n-117- \n \nThe WICI network \nAs described in Section 1.5, the WICI network focuses exclusively on intangibles reporting \nand on improving this reporting.  \n \nThe WICI Intangibles Reporting Framework106 was published in September 2016 and has the \nfollowing features: \n \n The Framework provides a definition of intangibles (which is fundamentally equivalent to \nthe concept of intellectual capital and offers a supplement to intangible assets as described \nin IAS 38)107  \n \n Intangibles are considered under the categories of organisational, human and relational \ncapital  \n \n The Framework is principles-based and does not prescribe the order of the three main \nsections of intangibles reporting \n \n The Framework describes how to build indicators and provides examples; and  \n \n Lastly, the indicators are articulated on three levels, general, industry-specific and \norganisation-specific. \n \nIndicators for ten sectors have been drawn up by regional working groups. The most-recent \nindicator, which was published in January 2019, deals with the Food and Beverage industry \nand was tabled by WICI Europe and France. \n \nIndustry  \nJurisdiction  \nPublication date  \nNumber of KPIs \nFood and Beverage KPIs \nOI-WICI France \nJanuary 2019 \n38 \nOil and Gas \nNIBR/WICI Italy \nApril 2016 \n56 \nElectricity Sector \nWICI Europe \nSeptember 2013 \n111 \nMining \nWICI US/Gartner \n \n \nHigh Technology \nWICI US/Gartner \n \n \nAutomotive \nWICI Japan \nJune 2010 \n24 \nElectronic Devices \nWICI Japan \nJune 2010 \n23 \nPharmaceuticals \nWICI Japan \nMay 2010 \n16 \nTelecommunications \nWICI Eur/EFFAS \nOctober 2010 \n59 \nFashion and Luxury \nWICI Eur/EFFAS \nMay 2011 \n114 \n \nThe indicators are identified on the basis of relevance and materiality in the value creation \nprocess for the sector’s companies. However, the creation of formal documentation has not \nbeen standardised and varies according to the teams which drafted it. The indicators are \nessentially quantitative at a given date and there is no positioning in relation to a target.  \n \n                                                           \n106 http://www.wici-global.com/framework  \n107 IAS 38: Intangible Assets, accounting standard on how to account for intangible assets. \n\n-118- \n \nIn France, the WICI has been hosted since 2015 and supported by the Observatoire de \nl’Immatériel108which also conducts its own work on intangibles.  \n \nThe Observatoire de l’Immatériel \nThe Observatoire de l’Immatériel is a non-profit organisation which was set up in 2007 and \nwhich aims to unify all stakeholders around intangibles, put forward innovative approaches, \nshare know-how, influence decision-makers and spur all the players into action109.    \n \nIn June 2012, the Observatoire de l’Immatériel and the Ministry for the Economy and \nFinance, represented by the Directorate General for Enterprise (DGE), executed an agreement \ngoverning collective action on “corporate intangibles”. The purpose of the agreement is to \nbuild a toolkit for companies relating to the management, assessment and leveraging of \ncorporate intangible assets. This actually takes the form of an intangible capital assessment \nframework called Thesaurus, which was published in 2011 (first part) and in 2015 (second \npart),110 with the initial goal of supplementing the IAS-IFRS.  \n \nThis method changes on a regular basis and is updated, autonomously, by a consulting firm \nGoodwill Management111: it assesses companies with a rating out of 20 on their intangible \nassets. The approach is more of an assessment than a reporting procedure although a number \nof tests have been conducted on the latter objective. The method relies on identifying metrics \nwhich are specific to each company and which are, at present, hardly able to be \nmainstreamed. \n \nIn addition to other actions, the Observatoire de l’Immatériel published a summary schedule \nof 26 indicators covering 10 categories of intangible assets in July 2015.   \n \nIn order to concretise this schedule and encourage company managers (VSEs/SMEs) to make \nuse of it, a framework focusing principally on the various value creation items for companies \nand their differentiating features (intangible resources) and with an essentially educational \ngoal, was designed and put online under the Cap’Immatériel112 banner in September 2018. \nThis framework sets out 10 categories of intangibles (Manager, Employee, Client, Trademark, \nKnowledge, Organisation, Digital Transformation, Partner, Shareholder and Regional \nEcosystem) covering 26 topics. Factsheets with suggestions for quantitative and qualitative \nindicators are also available online and allow the proposed approach, which has a more \nstrategic dimension and which allows for better knowledge and better management of the \ncompany and its environment than reporting, to be structured. \n \nThe International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) \nOwing to its objectives (managerial behaviour, reporting methodology, reporting approach/ \nstructuring), the IIRC does not provide a framework on intangibles as such. Nevertheless, the \nInternational <IR> Framework gives intangibles a true place by categorising and describing \nthree capitals (out of six) which are usually considered as constituting intangibles (see above):  \n                                                           \n108 http://observatoire-immateriel.com/  \n109 See « Les fondamentaux de l’Immatériel » published in 2017. \n110 Available on the Observatoire de l’Immatériel website. \n111 Thésaurus Capital Immatériel 2019: the practical framework for measuring corporate intangible assets. \n112 https://www.cap-immateriel.fr/referentiel/ \n\n-119- \n \n \n Intellectual capital: Organizational, knowledge-based intangibles, including: intellectual \nproperty, such as patents, copyrights, software, rights and licenses, “organizational \ncapital” such as tacit knowledge, systems, procedures and protocols. \n \n Human capital: People’s competencies, capabilities and experience, and their motivations \nto innovate, including (i) their alignment with and support for an organization’s \ngovernance framework, risk management approach, and ethical values; (ii) the ability to \nunderstand, develop and implement an organization’s strategy; (III) the loyalties and \nmotivations for improving processes, goods and services, including their ability to lead, \nmanage and collaborate; and \n \n Social and relationship capital: The institutions and the relationships within and between \ncommunities, groups of stakeholders and other networks, and the ability to share \ninformation to enhance individual and collective well-being. Social and relationship \ncapital includes: (i) shared norms, and common values and behaviours, (ii) key \nstakeholder relationships, and the trust and willingness to engage that an organization has \ndeveloped and strives to build and protect with external stakeholders, (iii) intangibles \nassociated with the brand and reputation that an organization has developed, (iv) an \norganization’s social license to operate. \n \nThe scope covering intangibles is therefore the same as that of the WICI with a compatible \nand consistent framework. These two bodies signed a cooperation agreement on 10 October \n2016113. Incidentally, on 23 March 2019, they published a joint position paper on “SDGs and \nIntangibles”.114  \n                                                           \n113 http://integratedreporting.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/WICI-and-IIRC.pdf \n114 http://www.wici-global.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190323.pdf  \n\n-120- \n \n2.6 Frameworks are expected to converge and stabilise  \nThe Corporate Reporting Dialogue (CRD) \nDue to the increasing number of topics, the difficulty in making extra-financial information \nconsistent and the growing number of global initiatives geared towards structuring either all \nthe topics or just some of them, a number of stakeholders joined forces in 2014 to set up an \ninitiative called the Corporate Reporting Dialogue115 (CRD) which “strives to strengthen \ncooperation, coordination and alignment between key standard setters and framework \ndevelopers that have a significant international influence on the corporate reporting \nlandscape”. \n \nThe work has the following specific objectives: \n Communicate about the direction, content and ongoing developments of reporting \nframeworks, standards and related requirements; \n \n Identify practical ways and means by which respective frameworks, standards and related \nrequirements can be explained and aligned, notably to avoid potential conflict, \ninconsistency and duplication between them; \n \n Clarify and resolve any emerging issues from their respective activities and other matters \nof common interest; \n \n Share relevant and significant information of direct interest to each other; and \n \n Express a common voice on areas of mutual interest, where possible, to engage with \ninterested parties, including regulators. \n \nThe CRD is hosted by the IIRC and is made up of the following eight stakeholders (Six in the \nnon-financial sphere and two accounting standard-setters): \n \n CDP: Carbon Disclosure Project \n CDSB: Climate Disclosure Standards Board \n GRI: Global Reporting Initiative \n IIRC: International Integrated Reporting Council \n ISO: International Organization for Standardization \n SASB: Sustainability Accounting Standards Board \n IASB: International Accounting Standards Board \n FASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board (observer) \nThe CRD’s initial work focused on principles of materiality which are inherent to any \ndiscussions on the disclosure of extra-financial information. Most of the stakeholders agree \nthat a comprehensive approach is not relevant and that only meaningful information should be \ncommunicated (information that is material for the relevant organisation either in terms of \nstrategy or monetary amount). This concept therefore appears in most of the frameworks. \n                                                           \n115 https://corporatereportingdialogue.com/ \n\n-121- \n \nConsequently, the CRD examined the concept of materiality as identified by its members and, \nin 2016, it published a Statement of Common Principles of Materiality.116  \n \nAlthough materiality may be defined differently depending on how the information is used \n(for strictly financial purposes or including all stakeholders), a proposal for a common \ndefinition is emerging: “Material information is any information which is reasonably capable \nof making a difference to the conclusions stakeholders may draw when reviewing the related \ninformation”. \n \nUp to now, work on the other reporting principles has not achieved a consensus and has not \nled to specific publications. This can be explained by the fact that the CRD is made up of \norganisations that operate according to different logics and with their own agendas. \n \nIn the short term, the CRD focuses its work on taking into account the recommendations of \nthe TCFD in the approach of each of its members (excluding the IASB and FASB). It has \npublished a consultation document in this respect117 (the consultation was opened until 30 \nApril 2019 and roundtables were organised in April and May 2019). The task force was able \nto participate in these discussions and although it noted an ambition for convergence, it also \nnoted a desire to differentiate between each of the CRD's members (taking into consideration \nthe differences in approaches and objectives that characterize them). \nThe first objective is for the CRD to submit its reports at the UN Climate Summit at the end \nof September 2019. Besides this highly pragmatic project, and according to information \nobtained by the task force, the CRD is looking into the strategic issue of the feasibility and \npossible conditions for convergence. \n \nAlthough, since 2014, there has been rapprochement/cooperation between the various private \n“standard-setters”, which was initially limited, the trend appears to have adopted a potentially \nmore proactive trajectory since early 2019 (see appendix 9 on the various memoranda of \nunderstanding between the different organisations). In the absence of public measures, the \noutcome of these initiatives in the short and medium terms is hard to predict. They do \nhowever undeniably represent the expression of strong expectations and are helping \nmove extra-financial information forward. \n \n \n                                                           \n116 https://corporatereportingdialogue.com/publication/statement-of-common-principles-of-materiality/ \n117 https://corporatereportingdialogue.com/better-alignment-project/#consultation  \n\n-122- \n \n \nThe following diagram drawn up by the Natural Capital Protocol sets out the positioning of \nthe frameworks which are most frequently used (i.e. CDP, CDSB, GRI, IIRC, ISO, GHG and \nSASB) on companies’ value chains and therefore shows the potential interaction between \nthese different frameworks: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-123- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAPTER 3 \n \nEXTRA-FINANCIAL REPORTING: AN EMERGING \nDISCIPLINE BESET BY PRACTICAL CHALLENGES \n\n-124- \n \n3.1 General principles: potential for common ground  \nThe bias of the destination of information \nLike accounting standards, which specify the intended audience of financial information \n(principally investors and providers of financial capital – see the table below), extra-financial \nreporting frameworks indicate those stakeholders for whom the information is intended, \nalthough standard-setting bodies also recognise that other stakeholders might find the \ndisclosures useful.118 The Corporate Reporting Dialogue (CRD) has published a Landscape \nMap119 detailing the intended audience for the following frameworks: IASB, FASB, IIRC, \nGRI, SASB and CDSB. The task force has updated the list to include the WICI and TCFD \nframeworks.  \n \nBody \nPurpose \nIntended \naudience \nIASB \nProvide high quality, transparent and comparable information \nfor investors, provide world capital markets with a common \nlanguage for financial reporting, promote capital market \nstability through transparent financial reporting and promote \nconsistent application of standards \nInvestors \nFASB \nEstablish and improve standards of financial accounting and \nreporting that foster financial reporting by nongovernmental \nentities to provide decision-useful information to investors and \nother users of financial reports \nInvestors \nGRI \nEnabling all organizations – regardless of size, sector or \nlocation – to report about their impacts on the economy, the \nenvironment, and/or society. \nAll stakeholders \nSASB \nEnable companies around the world to identify, manage and \ncommunicate financially-material ESG and sustainability \ninformation to their investors. \nInvestors \nIIRC \nHelp organizations explain to providers of financial capital \nhow they create value over time \nInvestors \nCDSB \nHelp organizations prepare and present environmental \ninformation in mainstream reports with the same rigor as \nfinancial information, to provide consistent, comparable and \nclear decision-useful information for investors \nInvestors \nWICI \nTo provide useful information for decision making, and in \nparticular resource allocation decisions, primarily to the \norganization's management as well as to the providers of \nfinancial capital including investors, creditors, and analysts. \nManagement and \nInvestors \nTCFD \nCould promote more informed investment, credit [or lending], \nand insurance underwriting decisions and, in turn, “would \nenable stakeholders to understand better the concentrations of \ncarbon-related assets in the financial sector and the financial \nsystem's exposures to climate-related risks. \nInvestors \n                                                           \n118 See IASB-FASB conceptual framework. \n119 See https://corporatereportingdialogue.com/landscape-map/  \n\n-125- \n \nAs the table above shows, GRI disclosures are intended for a wide audience. The fact that all \nthe other frameworks and standards are geared primarily towards investors (and, in the case of \nthe WICI, management) introduces inherent bias – in terms of the overall approach, the \nunderlying principles and, ultimately, the indicators used. \nMateriality: a common principle across all frameworks and standards \nMateriality was found to be a common feature of all the frameworks and standards. The CRD \nbegan by mapping definitions of the term before producing a summary (see Section 2.6). The \ndefinition of materiality is no longer a matter of debate: whether or not a disclosure is deemed \nmaterial depends entirely on user perceptions. \nA degree of consistency on other reporting principles \nThe table below shows the other principles that shape reporting requirements under the \nvarious frameworks and standards, and that guide organisations in preparing and presenting \ntheir information.

Based on the latest, published \nversions of the various standards and frameworks, the task force sees no impediment to \narriving at a unified definition of these principles. The task force conducted a detailed \ncomparison of the proposed definitions for each of the four most commonly occurring \nprinciples:  \n \n \n                                                           \n122 Common conceptual framework for IASB and FASB principles, published in 2010 following harmonisation \nwork between both organisations \n123 Directive 2013/43/UE – Article 4 « General provisions» and Article 6 “ General principals for financial \ninformation.” \n\n-127- \n \nComparability:  \nBody \nDefinition \nRemarks \nIIRC \nThe information should be presented: \n• On a basis that is consistent over time \n• In a way that enables comparison with other \norganizations to the extent it is material to the \norganization's own ability to create value over time \n Consistent over \ntime \n Comparable \nwith other \norganisations \nGRI \nThe reporting organization shall select, compile, \nand report information consistently.

The principle of \nconnectivity of information (or global coherence) is explicitly mentioned in the IIRC, WICI \nand TCFD frameworks and is a de facto principle of the European Directive insofar as it \namends EU Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU. Art. 3(6) (Consistent and coherent) of the EU \nGuidelines on Non-financial Reporting states the following: \n \n“The non-financial statement is expected to be consistent with other elements of the \nmanagement report. \nMaking clear links between the information presented in the non-financial statement \nand other information disclosed in the management report makes the information more \nuseful, relevant and cohesive. The management report should be viewed as a single, \nbalanced and coherent set of information.” \n \nYet it remains difficult to articulate how this connectivity plays out in practice.  \n \nAs the task force’s interviews confirmed, all of the stakeholders agree that, insofar as it shines \na spotlight on strategy, business model, and ESG risks and opportunities, extra-financial \nreporting gives a clearer picture of an organisation as a whole. Indeed, some extra-financial \ndisclosures might be considered “pre-financial information” in the sense that, long term, they \n\n-130- \n \ncould inform financial statements. Consequently, there are certain linkages between the \nfinancial and extra-financial aspects of how an organisation creates value.  \n \nIt comes as no surprise that integrated reporting (and integrated thinking more generally) \ndraws on these linkages: “Integrated reporting is a new way for organisations to think about \nand report on how they create lasting value. By combining aspects of financial and extra-\nfinancial performance, it gives a picture of an organisation’s medium-to-long-term strategy \nand its overall performance.”124 Likewise, senior executives are increasingly using integrated \nthinking as a day-to-day management and strategy tool. \n \n“Connectivity of information” is a guiding principle of the IIRC framework. The concept, \nwhich draws on the notion of integrated thinking,125 highlights the need for organisations to: \n \n Give a holistic picture and demonstrate linkages between factors; \n \n Clarify the relationship between past, present and forward-looking information; \n \n Explain interdependencies and trade-offs between the capitals, and how changes affect the \nability of the organisation to create value; \n \n Report on research and development, investment and environmental policies, as well as on \ncustomer relationships, and how these factors could impact the organisation’s financial \nstatements; \n \n Contextualise KPIs with qualitative information; \n \n Be transparent as regards the information shared internally with management; \n \n Ensure consistency across all communications. \nBeyond mere reporting, connectivity of information is a useful principle for organisations to \nfollow for other reasons: \n \n Internally, it increases awareness of the multi-dimensional nature of performance and, by \nhelping organisations identify and monitor risk, leads to improved strategic and \noperational management (and, ultimately, more responsible management practices). \n \n Externally, it helps organisations better manage externalities with their stakeholders, \ngives third parties a clearer picture of how an organisation creates value (including in \nareas not captured by financial statements), makes risk easier to predict, and allows an \norganisation to prevent reputational risk and manage its image and brands dynamically. In \nshort, organisations with connected information are able to build a compelling narrative \nand communicate in ways that are easily comprehensible. \n \n                                                           \n124 Medef, CSR Commission, Retours d’expérience sur le reporting intégré, November 2017 \n125 The IIRC defines “integrated thinking” as follows: “The active consideration by an organisation of the \nrelationships between its various operating and functional units and the capitals that the organisation uses or \naffects. Integrated thinking leads to integrated decision-making and actions that consider the creation of value \nover the short, medium and long term.” \n\n-131- \n \nIn practice, however, it remains difficult to articulate the relationship between financial and \nextra-financial information – not least how such information changes with the passage of time \n– because: \n \n A potential risk reported in one financial year may, in subsequent years, become a \nconstructive obligation and, later, give rise to a liability (or an asset);  \n \n There is an ongoing “dialogue” between “moral” and legal obligations, and rule changes \nmay require organisations to factor in externalities that were not previously recognized; \n \n The concept of “pre-financial information” adds a further layer of complexity, and \norganisations need to identify future events that could trigger inward or outward resource \nflows. \nMoreover, connecting financial and non-financial disclosures in a way that is easy to \nunderstand requires detailed contextual and narrative information. Consequently, it would \nappear difficult to arrive at a harmonised definition of “connectivity of information” \nabove and beyond its general principles. \n \n \n\n-132- \n \n3.2 Corporate reporting: a complex, disparate landscape \nGeneral framework in the European Union \nThe simplified overview below describes the open-ended corporate reporting structure as \nderived from two European Directives: \n \n Directive 2013/34/EU: \n− chapters 3 and 4, which cover financial statements and notes to financial statements \n− chapter 5, which covers mandatory reports and the content of those reports: the \nmanagement report (Art. 19), the non-financial statement (Art. 19a), and the corporate \ngovernance statement (Art. 20) \n \n Directive 2004/109/EC,126 which contains additional reporting requirements for listed \ncompanies, including what information they are required to report on securities \ntransactions, what reports they must publish (including the management report), when \nthey must publish them (no later than four months after the end of the financial year), and \nwhich bodies supervise them. \n \nThe European corporate reporting structure, which remains largely generic, may be \nsummarised as follows: \n \nManagement report \nNon-financial statement \nfor listed companies \nCorporate governance \nstatement \nFair \nreview \nof \nthe \ndevelopment \nand \nperformance \nof \nthe \norganisation’s business and \nof its position, together with \na description of the principal \nrisks and uncertainties that it \nfaces. Analysis \nconsistent \nwith the size and complexity \nof the business. \nInformation \non \nthe \norganisation’s \nperformance \nand impact of its activity \nrelating to environmental, \nsocial \nand \nemployment \nmatters, as well as respect for \nhuman rights, anti-corruption \nand bribery matters. \nReference to the corporate \ngovernance code to which \nthe organisation is subject. \nAn \nindication \nof \nthe \norganisation’s likely future \ndevelopment and activities in \nthe field of research and \ndevelopment. \nDescription \nof \nthe \norganisation’s \nbusiness \nmodel, the policies pursued \nand the outcome of those \npolicies, and the principal \nassociated risks. \nDescription of the internal \ncontrol system. \nSpecific \ninformation \non \nbranches, \nfinancial \ninstruments, and financial \nrisk management. \nReporting of non-financial \nkey performance indicators. \nThe organisation’s diversity \npolicy and objectives. \n \n \n                                                           \n126 Amended by Directive 2013/50/EU \n\n-133- \n \nThe following conclusions may be drawn from the above: \n The provisions are succinct; \n The framework is extremely generic;  \n The rules are silent on the reporting format. \n \nAccessibility of extra-financial information: poor coordination and no clear, \ncomprehensive reporting structure – at national and European levels  \nThe consequences of an ever-growing body of reporting requirements are twofold: first, the \nEuropean framework is not properly harmonised (even within the Accounting Directive \nitself), and second, the Directive has not been transposed uniformly into Member States’ \ndomestic law: \n \n Under the European framework, organisations have two options for reporting extra-\nfinancial information: either (i) within the management report (in accordance with Art. 30 \nof the 2013 Accounting Directive), or (ii) in a separate report (mentioned explicitly in the \nmanagement report) published on the organisation’s website no later than six months after \nthe end of the financial year.  \n \n Transposition of the Directive into Member States’ domestic law (see below and \nAppendix 5) has further polarised reporting practices, leaving even attentive readers \nstruggling to find the information they need, especially when seeking to compare \norganisations in different countries.  \n \nFrench extra-financial reporting legislation, which pre-dates European law and includes \nobligations arising from the 2001 New Economic Measures Law and the Grenelle \nEnvironment process, imposes stricter requirements. It set out a precise list of subjects that \norganisations must report on (after conducting a materiality assessment), requires \norganisations to disclose the information in their management report, and imposes tough \nexternal verification (covering both content and compliance with reporting obligations). The \nframework has been tightened further in recent years, with new rules on duty of vigilance, \nanti-corruption planning and climate reporting. While French legislation has its merits (it \nencourages organisations to adopt robust extra-financial reporting practices, to be more \nconcise on materiality, and to be transparent about the methods they use), it nevertheless \nremains complex. In France, organisations must include a detailed Statement on Extra-\nFinancial Performance in their management report. However, the law does not explicitly \ndefine what this report entails (see chapter 1). The decree merely provides a list of the items it \nshould contain. As a result, organisations are free to structure their management report – and \nto incorporate it into their registration document – as they see fit.  \n\n-134- \n \nLikewise, in its Guide to Compiling Registration Documents,127 the Autorité des Marchés \nFinanciers (AMF) does not specify what format listed companies should use. Annex 1 (p. 62) \nprovides the following guidance: \n \nThe contents of the registration document are defined by the European Regulation \nimplementing the Prospectus Directive. In the context of a financial transaction, the \nregistration document may be incorporated into a prospectus filed with the AMF for \napproval, enabling the organisation to satisfy its reporting requirements and have its \nregistration document examined within five working days. \n \nThe AMF is often asked how the registration document should be presented, how it \nrelates to the annual financial report and other documents presented to the General \nMeeting of shareholders, how it should be distributed, and how the statement by the \nperson responsible for the document should be drafted. For ease of reference, the AMF \nhas put together a list of answers to frequently asked questions about how to compile \nregistration documents. \n \nAre there any rules on how a registration document should be formatted? \nIn practice, registration documents fall into one of two categories: \n-  Registration documents for equity securities, which follow the format laid down in \nAnnex I to the European Regulation. \n-  Free-form registration documents, especially those following the format of an annual \nreport. The AMF General Regulation states that the “registration document can take \nthe form of an annual report to shareholders”. In its guide on financial reporting for \ncompanies listed on Euronext Paris, the AMF states that “the annual financial report, \nor the registration document, may serve as the basis for the report presented to the \nGeneral Meeting of shareholders, provided that it is supplemented with the \ninformation required by the French Commercial Code”. Free-form registration \ndocuments must include a comparative table containing the sections laid down in \nAnnex I to the European Regulation. \nOrganisations may therefore opt for either of these formats, as their communication \npolicy and needs dictate. As a general rule, however, the registration document is not \nintended for shareholders and private investors, but instead provides abundant and \ndetailed information for financial analysts and institutional investors. \n \nThe following questions, raised by the stakeholders that the task force interviewed, point to \ndifficulties around the structure of the Statement on Extra-Financial Performance: \n \n Should the Statement on Extra-Financial Performance explicitly mention, or at least refer \nto, the business model, risk and taxation information contained in the organisation’s \nannual report and the registration document? How should this information be presented?  \n \n How does the Statement on Extra-Financial Performance tie in with the concept of \nintegrated reporting? Should the Statement on Extra-Financial Performance form the \nopening section of the registration document? \n                                                           \n127 https://www.amf-france.org/Reglementation/Doctrine/Doctrine-\nlist/Doctrine?docId=workspace%3A%2F%2FSpacesStore%2F0781ea1e-6eef-495e-ae23-\n7dbac9e435c4&category=I+-+Emetteurs+et+information+financi%C3%A8re&docVersion=3.0  \n\n-135- \n \n \n Should the climate report (as required by Art. 173 of the Energy Transition and Green \nGrowth Act, and as recommended by the TCFD) appear in the Statement on Extra-\nFinancial Performance, or should it be dealt with separately?  \n \n Should details of the duty-of-care plan appear in the Statement on Extra-Financial \nPerformance or in a standalone document? Organisations must report on “main risks” in \ntheir Statement on Extra-Financial Performance128 and on “risks of serious harm” in their \nduty-of-care plan. Are these concepts one and the same? \n \n How much detail should the Statement on Extra-Financial Performance provide about the \norganisation’s anti-corruption plan (as required under the Transparency, Anti-Corruption \nand Economic Modernisation Act)? \n \nWhile organisations are required by law to publish a Statement on Extra-Financial \nPerformance and a management report, there are no rules or even guidance – in the Directive \nor elsewhere – on how extra-financial information should be laid out. Organisations are free \nto choose their own format. This lack of standardisation creates a complex regulatory \nlandscape and makes extra-financial information difficult to use and analyse. \n \nIn an exploratory paper129 presented at the Accounting research symposium in December \n2018, Hervé Stolowy, Luc Paugam and Emmanuel Da Costa examined disparate extra-\nfinancial reporting practices and formats among CAC 40-listed firms for the 2017 financial \nyear. The authors found that the organisations in question:  \n \n Disclosed extra-financial information in multiple reports (between 1 and 4 per company, \nand in 2.37 reports on average) \n \n Used a variety of different names for these reports – not least the registration document, \nfor which they found no fewer than seven different names:  \n \n “Registration Document” \n “Registration Document and Financial Report” \n “Registration Document” (also referred to as “Integrated Report”) \n “Registration Document” (also referred to as “Integrated Report”” and “Financial and \nSustainability Report”) \n “Registration Document, including Integrated Report” \n “Annual Report” (equivalent to registration document and financial report) \n                                                           \n128 According to Art. 2 of the decree of 9 August 2017 implementing ordinance no. 2017-1180 of 19 July 2017 \non the disclosure of extra-financial information by certain large companies and groups, and to Art. R.225-105(I) \nof the French Commercial Code, the Statement on Extra-Financial Performance should include: “1° A \ndescription of the main risks inherent in the company’s or group’s activities including, where relevant and \nproportionate, risks inherent in its business dealings, products or services”.  \nAccording to Art. 1 of the law of 27 March 2017 on the duty of vigilance for parent companies and main \ncontractors, and to Art. L.225-102-4 of the French Commercial Code: “The plan contains reasonable duty-of-\nvigilance measures to identify risks and prevent serious harm to human rights and fundamental freedoms, to \npublic health and safety, and to the environment, from the activities of the company and of the companies under \nits control”.  \n129 Stolowy H., Paugam H., Da Costa E., Reporting non financier des sociétés du CAC 40 : multiplicité des \nrègles et hétérogénéité des pratiques: http://www.anc.gouv.fr/cms/sites/anc/accueil/recherche/etats-generaux-de-\nla-recherche-c.html  \n\n-136- \n \n “Registration Document” specifically mentioning “CSR” on the cover page. \n \n The companies adopted equally inconsistent titles for their other reports: \n \n “Integrated Report” \n “Integrated Report: Reference Document Extract” \n “Integrated Report” (title in English) \n “CSR Report” \n “CSR Report: Reference Document Extract” \n “Sustainability Report” (title in English) \n “Environment/Climate Report” \n “CSR/Integrated Report” \n “Annual Extra-Financial Report” \n “Essentials” \n “Activity”. \n \nThere is every reason to question why organisations publish other reports beyond their \nregistration document which, it could be argued, is itself an “integrated” report insofar as it \ngives a comprehensive overview of the company’s business, strategy, aims and external \nrelationships. Although companies lay out their registration documents differently, they \ntypically follow a similar format: overview of the company and its business, corporate \ngovernance, strategy, risks, corporate social responsibility, financial information, investor \nrelations, and regulated information (board of directors’ or supervisory board’s report, \nstatutory auditors’ report). What, then, is the purpose of an integrated report (as defined by the \nIIRC) other than to clarify how the various disclosures are connected (see Section 3.3 below)? \n \nPublishing multiple reports adds confusion to corporate communication. In the task \nforce’s view, organisations should publish fewer reports and present their extra-\nfinancial information in a more standardised format for the sake of clarity and \ncomparability. \n \n \n \n\n-137- \n \n3.3 Too much choice: how flexibility obstructs comparability \nPick-and-choose approach to content \nAs the review of legislation and standards earlier in this report shows, the decision on which \nextra-financial indicators to report is left almost entirely to issuers. Given the sheer \nbreadth and variety of subjects that these disclosures cover, there is little scope for \nestablishing a uniform, exhaustive extra-financial reporting framework. \n \nIssuers (as detailed below) can pick and choose which standard(s) or framework(s) they wish \nto follow. In France, for instance, companies that follow the GRI framework tend to include a \n“comparative table” at the end of their registration document, between the GRI indicator list \nand their own indicators, indicating the relevant page(s) of the report. Some issuers refer to \nmore than one reporting framework, and some even go so far as to create their own \nframework.  \n \nSchneider Electric is an illustrative case in point. In its 2018 registration document, the firm \nstates that it adheres to the following standards and frameworks: \n \n United Nations Global Compact \n ISO 26000 (for supplier relations) \n GRI (including a comparative table) \n SASB (industry-specific sustainability accounting standards) \n TCFD. \nSchneider Electric has also developed a set of internal ethical standards and guidelines for \nday-to-day management and, since 2018, has published a set of “Schneider Sustainability \nImpact” indicators.  \n \nSchneider Electric Financial and Sustainable Annual Report – page 96130  \n \n“For each of its five major challenges (Climate, Circular Economy, Ethics, Health and \nEquity, Development), Schneider Electric sets ambitious objectives, which will require \nthe Group to improve each year. The 2018-2020 Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) is \nwritten into the 2015-2020 corporate program and includes 21 key performance \nindicators. Once each performance is converted into a score based on 10, the average of \nthese scores indicates the overall performance of the SSI, with all the indicators having \nthe same weight.” \n \nAs the above analysis shows, none of the frameworks has binding rules on:  \n how exhaustive the indicators should be, and \n \n which subjects should be covered? \nNevertheless, all of the frameworks have a materiality assessment as their centrepiece (as \ndoes the European Directive; see Chapter 1 for more details). In other words, the issuer should \n                                                           \n130 https://annualreport.se.com/index.html – see pages 94-104 \n\n-138- \n \nreport on those subjects that, in its judgement, best represent its business – and select its \nindicators accordingly. In choosing their disclosures, organisations follow the “comply or \nexplain” model, i.e. they either comply with the standard or explain why they have not done \nso. Conversely, issuers tend not to justify their choice of indicators, and are free to select them \nas they see fit. The organisations questioned by the task force said they appreciated this \nflexible approach, since it enabled them to select only those indicators that were relevant \nto their business.  \n \nIn summary, the fact that issuers are free to pick and choose what they disclose means that, at \npresent, there is no implicit path towards a common, structured and comparable reporting \nmethod. In practice, because organisations follow (or, in the case of integrated reporting, \nclaim to be inspired by) more than one framework, they produce idiosyncratic reports that \nmake comparison between issuers – and across sectors – an almost impossible task. \n \nThe challenges of electronic extra-financial reporting \nThis complex, disparate landscape poses a major obstacle to electronic reporting, despite \nuniversal acknowledgement that shifting away from paper-based reporting would help issuers \nreach a wider audience, and make their disclosures more easily exploitable (in terms of \nstructure and ease of access). This was a view shared by all of the users of extra-financial \ninformation interviewed by the task force: companies (for comparability reasons), ESG \nanalysts, investors, and other stakeholders more generally (for information access reasons). \n \nIt stands to reason, however, that such a shift to electronic reporting can only happen if there \nis a standardised reporting framework (with a pre-defined format), and if all issuers adhere \nuniformly to that standard (even if they do so voluntarily). Yet, as the detailed analysis above \ndemonstrates, that is far from the case at present: \n Issuers use a variety of different frameworks, with no standardised naming convention or \nstructure \n \n Quantitative indicators and metrics are poorly and inconsistently defined, which makes it \ndifficult to develop a structured classification system \n \n Descriptive, narrative information, and qualitative indicators, make up a large part of \nextra-financial disclosures \nHowever, the more structured frameworks (GRI, SASB and CDP) already include a \nclassification system for quantitative and qualitative indicators, for electronic collection \nand referencing purposes. Moreover, talks are ongoing within the EU on a new \nsustainability taxonomy – a classification system of climate, environmentally and socially \nsustainable activities – to support implementation of the TCFD recommendations. There are \nno plans for a similar classification system for the other frameworks and standards, which are \nmore open-ended and merely offer a set of principles.  \n \nFinancial information systems have traditionally been designed to aggregate historical \naccounting data, expressed in monetary units, according to a given accounting standard. \nAlthough it is now technically possible (with XBRL language) to “tag” both monetary and \nnon-monetary information, electronic financial reporting remains neither optimal nor \n\n-139- \n \nstabilised.131 Aside from various national initiatives, efforts at EU level should lead to a \nsituation where, by end-2022, all issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a \nregulated market in Europe use a harmonised electronic format for financial reporting. \n \nElectronic extra-financial reporting poses an even greater challenge because the information \ncomes from a variety of sources and non-integrated systems (HR, payroll, supply chain, \nindividual suppliers, customer relations, customer feedback and satisfaction surveys, disputes \nand whisteblowing reports, etc.). Consequently there is, in practice, no electronic system \nfor extra-financial reporting.  \n \nExtra-financial reporting covers a vast range of subjects, and disclosures are often qualitative \nand forward-looking in nature. Any shift towards structured, electronic reporting will \nnecessarily require an overhaul of existing information systems so that they capture this \nlargely qualitative information – information that companies already possess, but that is not \nsystematically collected, stored, compiled and linked to reporting indicators. The current trend \namong listed companies, according to an internal study performed by Afep/Medef early 2019, \nis to have a central head office team (typically between three and ten people) working solely \non extra-financial reporting (regardless of format), supported by focal points in functional \ndepartments and subsidiaries who gather and feedback relevant information. \n \nThe analysis above shows that, for the time being, European-level efforts should \ncontinue to focus on electronic financial reporting. Extra-financial reporting should \nbecome a priority at a later stage.  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n131 EU rules on electronic financial reporting stem from Directive 2013/50/EU amending the Transparency \nDirective (2004/109/EC), which requires companies to prepare their annual financial reports in a single \nelectronic reporting format from 1 January 2020. The classification system, developed by the European \nSecurities and Markets Authority (ESMA), is based on the XBRL standard and on the IFRS taxonomy, which \nhas been updated annually since 2010. The new standard will be phased in. For financial years commencing on \nor after 1 January 2020, companies will only be required to prepare their summary financial statements in the \nnew electronic format. The requirement will cover disclosures contained in the notes to the consolidated annual \nfinancial statements (including explanatory and qualitative information) from 1 January 2022 onwards. \n\n-140- \n \n3.4 Extra-financial reporting: a movement that is gaining momentum \nExtra-financial reporting moves forward in most developed countries  \nRecent notable advances in extra-financial reporting can be attributed to two factors: rising \ndemand from investors and the public, and a growing body of laws and regulations in many \nparts of the world, not least in Asia and the European Union.  \n \nIn a 2017 report, KPMG looked at the CSR reporting practices of 4,900 companies. It found \nthat three-quarters of the firms had issued some form of CSR report in 2017, with a reporting \nrate of 60% or more in every sector (the highest rates were in those sectors with the greatest \nenvironmental and social impact, such as oil & gas, chemicals, mining and automotive).   \n \nCompanies are increasingly embracing CSR reporting, no doubt as a consequence of \never-tougher domestic rules on extra-financial disclosures, a tightening of corporate \ngovernance practices, and the growing influence of institutional investors. According to a \njoint WBCSD and CDSB study,132 Japan is now second worldwide for integrated reporting – \na trend consistent with recent advances in corporate governance in the country (see Appendix \n9). The picture is similar in South Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom, where the law \nencourages companies to prepare integrated reports. Based on information gathered by the \ntask-force, extra-financial reporting is much less common practice in the United States, \nhowever, despite important legislative advances (financial impacts of compliance with \nenvironmental laws since the 1970s, growing investor awareness since the early 2000s133, \npublication of guidelines in 2010, and development of a climate risk typology). This situation \ncan be attributed to a number of factors: the fact that there is no legal definition of \n“sustainability”, a lack of political ambition (ESG performance is not specifically addressed in \nU.S. corporate and financial law), and American business culture, in which companies, fearful \nof being sued, prioritise risk prevention over extra-financial reporting.  \n \nIn France, large companies are stepping up their extra-financial reporting practices and \nbuilding ESG factors into risk mapping and strategy for two reasons. First, they are now \nrequired, by law, to prepare a Statement on Extra-Financial Performance. And second, \nin its 2016 report on corporate social, societal and environmental responsibility, the AMF \nrecommended a “more integrated approach when this enables investors to better assess the \nvalue creation strategy and overall performance of the company”. Moreover (see Section 1.6 \nbelow), some large groups have taken a proactive stance and published environmental – or \neven integrated – profit and loss accounts. In an internal Afep-Medef survey of 35 companies, \ncarried out as part of the task force’s work, 63% said they had published an integrated report – \nand most of the remainder said they had referred, at least in part, to the IIRC framework. \n \n \n \n                                                           \n132 https://www.cdsb.net/sites/default/files/wbcsd_japancasestudy_online_final_2019.pdf  \n133 See Appendix 9 for more details. \n\n-141- \n \nWhy companies have embraced extra-financial reporting \nIn economics, transaction cost theory (Coase, 1937 and Williamson, 1975) refers to the cost \nof providing for a good or service through the market, serving as a guide for, among other \nthings, resource allocation decisions. When information is asymmetrical, adverse-selection \nrisk134 can limit investment in a security. That risk should push issuers towards higher levels \nof disclosure, provided that the cost of disclosure does not outweigh its benefits.   \nBased on empirical evidence, this theory explains why issuers seeking investment tend to \nover-disclose extra-financial information.  \n \nIn sociology, new institutionalism explains how institutional pressures force organisations (in \nthis case, companies) to become more similar (i.e. to show isomorphism), including in how \nthey disclose extra-financial information. These pressures come in three guises: coercive \n(legal or political pressures), normative (pressure to adhere to professional codes of conduct), \nand mimetic (pressure to copy successful competitors). This school of thought explains why \ncompanies operating in certain industries or countries, in fiercely competitive markets, or \nunder intense media scrutiny, tend to disclose more information. On that basis, a particular \ntype of company is likely to be more transparent about its disclosures than others: a large \ncompany, listed on multiple exchanges, with little debt and a high number of shareholders, \nwidely tracked by analysts, and operating in either a tech-heavy industry or a sector known \nfor its environmental or social impact. \nThe work of Patricia Crifo and Antoine Rébérioux (2015)135 on changing corporate \ngovernance models is worth mentioning at this juncture.  \n \nRecent institutional developments, coupled with changes in shareholder structure and the \nemergence of sustainable finance, have radically altered the two leading models of corporate \ngovernance: shareholder and stakeholder. Differences between the two models are narrowing \nwith the passage of time – on capital structure, disclosure requirements, board composition, \nand emphasis on stakeholders and sustainability.  \n \nIn both the United States and Europe, disclosure requirements – fueled by the financial \nscandals of the 1990s and 2000s, and growing calls for transparency among investors – have \nbecome an increasingly powerful tool for enforcing stricter discipline and accountability \namong senior executives. The emergence of corporate governance codes and associated \ninternational principles – following the “comply or explain” model – are a case in point. The \ngrowth of socially responsible investing has merely added to the burden on executives, and \nseen sustainability rise to prominence in the governance agenda. Integrated corporate \ngovernance has progressively become the norm, as companies look longer term and focus on \nsocial value creation.  \n \n \n                                                           \n134 Information asymmetry can cause investors to shield themselves against bad investments by offering an \naverage price that is below the fair value of a good investment but higher than the fair value of a bad investment. \nThat, in turn, can eliminate the best investments from the market, leaving only poorer-quality investments \nbehind.  \n135 P.

Crifo and A. Rébérioux (2015), “Gouvernance et responsabilité sociétale des entreprises: nouvelle \nfrontière de la finance durable”, Revue d’économie financière, no.117, pp. 205-223. \n \nLikewise, extra-financial reporting is no longer “merely” a matter for CSR and corporate \ncommunications teams. Companies now see extra-financial information as integral to the \nmanagement of their business, with board members actively involved in reviewing and \napproving disclosures. Some companies such as Kering (which the task force consulted; see \nSection 1.6) publish environmental profit and loss accounts (or EP&Ls). Again, a similar rule \napplies: the EP&L ties in closely with the company’s overall strategy, including its \nsustainability strategy.  \n \nThere are several underlying reasons for this trend:  \n Corporate governance models are evolving (see above), in terms of both shareholder \nstructure (more looking for a long-term stability) and board diversity (more independent \ndirectors and ad-hoc committees).  \n \n Changing regulations have given boards an increasingly prominent role in extra-financial \nreporting. In France, companies must include their Statement on Extra-Financial \nPerformance in their management report, which the board of directors or executive board \nmust approve. For instance, Art. 173 (III) of the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act \nrequires companies to address climate risk in the chairman’s annual report.  \n \n Companies are following the regulator’s recommendations. In its 2016 report on extra-\nfinancial reporting practices, the AMF noted that CAC 40-listed companies were \nincreasingly incorporating CSR aspects into their management and governance processes, \nand made the following recommendation: “The AMF recommends that companies that \nhave, within their board of directors or supervisory board, a specialised committee to deal \nwith social and environmental issues should provide specific information about its \nmembership, remit and findings, as well as its links with other board committees. The \nAMF also invites issuers to specify the frequency with which problems related to \nsustainable development and social and environmental responsibility are included in the \nagenda of one or more specialised board committees.”  \n \n Shareholders are increasing the pressure on directors at general meetings, demanding \ngreater transparency on extra-financial aspects and raising concerns about social and/or \nenvironmental controversies that could pose reputational and regulatory risk.  \n\n-143- \n \nIn recent years, these developments have caused a discernible spike in extra-financial \nreporting workload for CSR and sustainability departments. The above-mentioned \ninternal Afep-Medef survey revealed that, on average, extra-financial reporting costs for a \nlarge company (including information system upgrades) stand at around €170,000 per year136. \nOf the 35 companies that responded to the survey, half said extra-financial reporting costs \nwere “high but not disproportionately so”, while one-quarter described them as “excessive”. \nThe same survey (confirmed during interviews conducted by the task force) found that head \noffice payroll costs for extra-financial reporting equate to three full-time equivalent (FTE) \nstaff, albeit with significant disparities according to company size and structure. In addition, \nthat figure does not always include non-CSR staff who contribute to extra-financial reporting \nthroughout the year (either at head office or, for instance, at production sites or in local \nsubsidiaries).  \n \nAn ongoing learning process: inconsistent practices in a quest for completeness  \nThrough its observations and analysis, the task force found that extra-financial reporting is \nvery much an ongoing learning process in which companies: \n \n constantly adapt their practices as extra-financial reporting standards and \nframeworks evolve: the introduction of the Statement on Extra-Financial Performance \nwas very much a watershed moment and, more recently, the publication of SASB \nindustry-specific standards has forced European companies to rethink their reporting \npractices \n \n test out a diverse array of value-chain models (to comply, among other things, with \nduty-of-care obligations, as well as with extra-financial reporting framework and rating \nagency rules on subcontractors and group make-up), stakeholder maps (according to \nwhere they are positioned within their ecosystem, what influence they have, and what \ncommitments they have made to their stakeholders), issue matrices (from the generic to \nthe specific, depending on the nature of their business and their ecosystem), and business \nprocess and governance alignment models  \n \n rework their KPIs (environmental, social and societal) to fit stakeholder expectations \nand business operations.  \nThe task force found that companies cast a wide net when selecting which reporting \nstandards and frameworks to follow and, in most cases, combine several to create their own \ndistinctive model:  \n Companies tend to draw inspiration from a multitude of frameworks and standards – both \n“methodological” (such as CDSB for climate disclosure) and “behavioural” (such as \nIIRC) – and pick and choose those principles and concepts they wish to adopt, rather than \nfollowing them to the letter.  \n \n In a quest for compliance, companies use standards and frameworks that provide \nappropriate ESG indicators and metrics, such as GRI, which is the most commonly used \nstandard by companies in France and worldwide (most of the companies covered by the \n                                                           \n136 This figure, coming from the Afep/Medef study performed in the frame of this report early 2019, is at this \nstage widely approximative and would benefit from a deeper analysis.  \n\n-144- \n \nglobal KPMG report cited above used the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines in \n2017).  \n \nMore often than not, however, the task force found that compliance was a retrospective \nexercise, i.e. companies prepare their reports first, then include a comparative table \nshowing where relevant disclosures for the GRI standards and/or guidelines appear in \ntheir Statement on Extra-Financial Performance, sustainability report, or elsewhere. \n \nThe French company Total’s extra-financial reporting practices are especially telling:  \n \n On its standalone sustainable performance website, Total states that it publishes its \nfinancial and extra-financial disclosures in its annual registration document. It also \npublishes reports detailing its sustainability strategy and policies: \n \n− an integrated report (chapter 1 of the registration document)  \n− an extra-financial performance statement (chapter 5 of the registration document)  \n− a duty-of-care (or vigilance) plan  \n− dedicated thematic reports (a climate report and a human right briefing document).  \n \n Total also publishes separate reports for each of the international reporting standards to \nwhich it adheres (GRI, UN Global Compact, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), \nVoluntary Principles on Security & Human Rights, CDP and IPIECA. In practice, \nhowever, these separate reports are merely comparative tables that it prepares in order to \n“comply” with thematic standards and frameworks that it considers important to its \nbusiness and its stakeholders. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Excerpt of Total’s comparative table showing linkages between its extra-financial disclosures for 2017-\n2018 and the GRI standard (published July 2018).137 \n \n \n                                                           \n137 \nAvailable \nonline \nat: \nhttps://www.sustainable-\nperformance.total.com/sites/shared/sustainable/files/atoms/files/gri_disclosures_report_2017_vdef.pdf  \n\n-145- \n \nAs mentioned earlier, more and more companies are adhering to so-called “thematic” \nframeworks such as CDP (which is growing in popularity worldwide), the TCFD \nRecommendations, and two widely used UN frameworks: the Global Compact and the \nSDGs. Yet these frameworks are less reporting standards per se and more a set of extra-\nfinancial reporting objectives that companies follow in order to cater to demand from \ninvestors and other external stakeholders (such as NGOs and extra-financial rating \nagencies).  \n \nIn addition to the somewhat generic frameworks listed above, the task force found that many \ncompanies also follow (again, often partially) a wide range of industry- and subject-specific \nstandards and frameworks. Examples include IPIECA (for oil & gas companies), the Equator \nPrinciples (for financial institutions), focused ISO standards (e.g. ISO 30001 for risk \nmanagement), and the Gimélec Industry Guide to CSR Reporting (for electrical equipment \nmanufacturers).  \n \nA movement borne out by empirical academic research \nA growing body of empirical research has emerged over the past two decades, especially \nin the United States, with academics appearing to find a positive correlation between \nextra-financial disclosure and social and financial performance.  \n \nVarious studies have demonstrated a link between how transparent an organisation is and how \n“virtuous” is it perceived to be, and between good corporate governance and overall \nperformance:  \n \n Gompers et al. (2003)138 found that good corporate governance (as measured by the level \nof shareholder rights) correlates positively with overall performance (as measured by \nequity prices and revenue growth).  \n \n Christensen (2016) also supported the premise that transparency and virtue go hand in \nhand, demonstrating that companies with transparent social reporting practices are less \nlikely to face future legal action for corruption or discrimination.  \n \nIt is worthwhile noting, at this juncture, that many academics have concerns about the \nmethods used to measure social performance:  \n \n The methodological drawbacks most frequently cited by academics concern confusion, \nand even inconsistency, in how samples are selected and variables are measured, and in \nwhat causal links are tested (Orlitsky et al., 2003) – due in large part to a lack of \nuniformity in social performance metrics. Some academics question whether measuring \n“corporate social responsibility” is, in fact, a worthwhile exercise, insofar as it is a poorly \ndefined concept that blurs the lines between financial and social/environmental \nperformance, ethics, and legal responsibility.  \n \n Empirical research into the linkages between social and financial performance is \ncomplicated further by the sheer number of social performance metrics, each with their \n                                                           \n138 P.A. Gompers, J.L Ishii and A. Metrick, “Corporate Governance and Equity Prices”, Quarterly Journal of \nEconomics, Vol. 118, No. 1, pp. 107-155, February 2003. \n\n-146- \n \nown set of criteria and variables (Pava and Krausz, 1996; Frooman, 1997; Griffin and \nMahon, 1997; McWilliams and Siegel, 1997; Balabanis, Phillips and Lyall, 1998; \nMargolis and Walsh, 2003; Orlitsky, Schmidt and Reynes, 2003).  \n \n There are also lingering doubts as to whether some investment decisions (in specific \ncompanies and/or sectors) are genuine examples of impact investing, and whether \ninvestors’ financial motives might differ from one investment type to the next.  \n \nA positive link between social performance and financial performance as measured by \naccounting indicators \n \nMost empirical research finds a positive link between a company’s social performance and its \nfinancial performance as measured by accounting indicators (Russo and Fouts, 1997; Kassinis \nand Soteriou, 2003; Fiede et al., 2015; Chopra and Wu, 2016). Early empirical studies \nperhaps failed to produce compelling findings because they focused on endogenous variables \n(the best-performing companies are those that can afford to channel resources into \nenvironmental and social issues). But, as methods improved over time, later researchers were \nable to discount these endogenous effects (“all else being equal”) and confirm the correlations \nidentified by their predecessors. Researchers have also found that companies that do well on \nsocial performance also tend to produce more robust financial information. For instance, Kim \net al. (2012) observed that, the more socially responsible a firm is, the more reliable its \naccounting indicators.  \n \nA positive correlation between ESG factors and financial and stock performance139 \n \nCorrelation between ESG factors and stock performance \n \nNumerous studies have found a positive correlation between environmental performance and \nstock performance (Lanoie and Laplante, 1992; Thomas, 2001; Grajam et al., 2001; Graham \nand Maher, 2006; Bauer and Hann, 2010; Albertini, 2013). The same correlation holds true \nfor those companies that manage their workforce responsibly (Kane et al., 2005; Brammer et \nal., 2009; Edmans, 2011; Faleye and Traham, 2011). Friede et al. (2015) conducted a meta-\nanalysis of more than 2,000 empirical studies since the 1970s. They found that, in 90% of \ncases, the studies showed no negative correlation between ESG and financial performance. In \nfact, in the vast majority of cases, there is a positive correlation, which often remains stable \nover time (Borgers et al., 2013). Khan (2016)140 looked at the value implications of \nsustainability investments, finding that firms with good ratings on material sustainability \nissues outperform firms with poor ratings, while the same does not hold true for immaterial \nsustainability issues – in other words, performance depends to a large extent on which ESG \ncriteria are selected.   \n \n \n                                                           \n139 In his speech on 21 march 2019, Mark Carney outlined: « The outperformance of strong ESG companies is \nuncorrelated with underlying factors such as return on equity or capital employed, and reflects greater earnings \nstability and lower share price volatility «. \n140 M. Khan (2016), “Corporate Sustainability: First Evidence on Materiality”, The Accounting Review, Vol. 91, \nNo. 6, pp. 1697-1724, November 2016.   \n\n-147- \n \nCorrelation between ESG factors and portfolio performance \nThere is growing evidence141 (including Clark et al., 2015) of a positive link between ESG \nperformance and long-term, risk-adjusted portfolio performance (a so-called “sustainability \npremium”). Similarly, divestment and exclusion strategies have no negative bearing on \nportfolio performance.  \n \nIt is important to note, however, that investors adopt a broad range of ESG and responsible \ninvesting strategies (ESG filters, best-in-class/best-in-universe strategies, exclusions, thematic \nfunds, engagement strategies, impact investing, etc.). Likewise, investment and resource-\nallocation decisions differ markedly according to investors’ objectives (risk management, \nalignment with ethical or social values, yield, social or environmental objectives, and even \nreputation risk management).142 \n \nCorrelation between ESG factors and sovereign bond spreads \nA noteworthy econometric study by Capelle-Blanchard, Crifo et al. (2018)143 revealed a \ntangible link between ESG performance and sovereign bond spreads in OECD countries. The \nauthors found that the link was strongest on social and governance dimensions (less so on the \nenvironmental dimension, largely because of the period covered by the study), and that the \neffect was amplified in euro area countries in a pre-crisis context. ESG performance, as a \nmarker of states’ long-term engagement, wields not insignificant influence on sovereign bond \nspreads.  \n \n \nThe task force found that, more often than not, there is a positive correlation (although \nnot necessarily a causal link) between a company or fund’s ESG performance and its \nfinancial performance. It would appear that those firms that integrate ESG factors into \ntheir strategy, operations and investment decisions are (like states) more likely to remain \nengaged over the long term, and be better governed – an important determinant of \nfinancial performance.  \n \n                                                           \n141 Clark, G.L., Feiner, A. and Viehs, M., From the Stockholder to the Stakeholder: How Sustainability Can \nDrive Financial Outperformance, 5 March 2015; Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management, ESG and Corporate \nFinancial Performance: Mapping the global landscape, December 2015; “Corporate Sustainability: First \nEvidence on Materiality”, The Accounting Review, Vol. 91, No. 6; NN Investment Partners and ECCE, The \nmateriality of ESG factors for equity investment decisions: academic evidence, 2016. \n142 See below.  \n143 Capelle-Blanchard, Crifo et al., “Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance and sovereign \nbond spreads: an empirical analysis of OECD countries”, Journal of Banking and Finance, 2018.  \n\n-148- \n \n3.5 A movement amplified by investor engagement \n«In the future, climate and ESG reporting will likely be at the heart of mainstream investing. \nInvestors will tailor their investments and fulfil their fiduciary duties through: better quality \nand more widely available data on sustainability and performance; superior data analytics \nthrough the advent of AI and Machine Learning; and more informed judgements of strategic \nresilience».  \nSource: Mark Carney, «A New Horizon», speech on 21 March 2019 \n“BlackRock’s Investment Stewardship engagement priorities for 2019 are: governance, \nincluding your company’s approach to board diversity; corporate strategy and capital \nallocation; compensation that promotes long-termism; environmental risks and opportunities; \nand human capital management. These priorities reflect our commitment to engaging around \nissues that influence a company’s prospects not over the next quarter, but over the long \nhorizons that our clients are planning for.” \n \nSource: Excerpt from Larry Fink’s (Chairman and CEO, BlackRock) 2019 letter to CEOs, 17 January 2019.144  \n \nFinancial sector expectations and engagement on the rise, especially since the Paris \nAgreement  \nThe financial sector has taken stock of shifting global trends on the environment, society and \ndigital technology, and come to the inevitable conclusion that business can no longer ignore \nclimate change, with all its environmental, social and societal consequences. Its impact \nstretches far and wide, from undermining the financial performance of companies in energy, \nreal-estate, transport and other sectors, to causing a dramatic crash in the value of fossil fuel-\nlinked securities. Indeed, the mutually reinforcing relationship between financial system \nvulnerability and climate change impacts has prompted the financial sector, and regulators, to \nacknowledge the emerging threat of systemic climate risk (Aglietta and Espagne, 2016).145 \nConsequently, the objectives of sustainable finance may be summarised as follows: to achieve \ngreater financial stability, to better capture and address social and environmental externalities \nand long-term risks and opportunities, and to ensure the financial sector plays a stronger role \nin fostering more sustainable economic growth. In other words, finance is not just about \nfilling the green investment gap to achieve the Paris Agreement target, but also – as Art. 2 of \nthe agreement itself states – about making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards \nclimate-resilient development.  \n \nThe financial sector is now taking climate issues seriously, in particular since the Paris \nAgreement was adopted in December 2015. This movement is characterised by three features: \ni. \nThe financial sector is stepping up its engagement in efforts to achieve the Paris \nAgreement targets: investors and asset managers are engaging in stakeholder activism, \nbanks and insurance companies are unilaterally divesting from – or at least limiting their \n                                                           \n144https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter  \n145 A situation in which climate change impacts cause shocks that spread through a process of contagion, leading \nto abrupt financial destabilisation.  \n\n-149- \n \nexposure to – the coal sector, and insurers and reinsurers are doing to more to support \nclimate resilience and protect against the growing threat of climate risk  \n \nii. \nFinancial institutions, especially institutional investors, are adopting new practices \n(beyond their public engagements as mentioned above): institutions are being more \ntransparent about how they factor ESG criteria into investment decisions, and adhering \nin growing number to the Principles for Responsible Investment (and the relevant \nprinciples for banks and insurance underwriters), while industry federations are \npublishing operational and implementation guides for clients, credit institutions, insurers \nand investment management companies.  \nFor instance:  \n In 2019, investment management company BlackRock (one of the firms interviewed by \nthe task force) published a client-facing report entitled Sustainability: The future of \ninvesting.146 In the report, the company says it expects to see exponential growth in ESG \ninvesting over the coming years (fuelled primarily by passively managed funds – see chart \nbelow), explains the rationale behind its decision to integrate ESG criteria into its \ninvestment strategies (see Section 3.4 below on ESG and financial performance), and \noutlines its sustainable investing practices.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: BlackRock Investment Institute, Sustainability: The future of investing, February 2019. \n \n Given the intrinsic characteristics of passive management, it is also important to highlight \nthe crucial role of active management: for example, in January 2019, Amundi published a \nstudy entitled \"The Alpha and Beta of ESG investing\", in which the European leader in \nasset management (in terms of assets under management) has analysed the impact of ESG \n                                                           \n146 BlackRock Investment Institute, Sustainability: The future of investing, February 2019. Available online at: \nhttps://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/whitepaper/bii-sustainability-future-investing-jan-2019.pdf  \n\n-150- \n \ncriteria on the performance of its portfolios (over the period 2010-2017). The results of the \nactive management study highlight ESG investment, since 2014, as a source of \noutperformance in Europe and North America. The report highlights as well as the \nvirtuous circle created by the intrinsic added value of ESG analysis. According to \nAmundi, this impact on performance is the result of the exponential increase in the interest \nof investors, mainly institutional investors, in ESG approaches (which generates flows \ntowards best-in-class equities, stimulating their prices and performance). Furthermore, in \nOctober 2018, Amundi announced a three-year strategic plan to strengthen its \ncommitment to responsible investment so that, by 2021, ESG analysis is integrated into all \nof its funds and initiatives promoting investment in projects with environmental and social \nimpact.  \n \n More and more institutional investors and asset owners are also becoming aware of their \nrole in taking climate risk (and more broadly ESG dimensions) into account in asset \nallocation policy and asset management. For example, the report \"173 reporting nuances - \nseason II: Analysis of climate and ESG reporting by the main French institutional \ninvestors\" published by Novethic (met by the task force) at the end of 2018 highlights : \n147 :  \n \n− Progress on taking climate risk into account: in 2018, majority of investors analysed in \nthe study report in measure and report the carbon footprint of their portfolios. This is \nnow an unavoidable preamble to the implementation of climate analysis, even if \ncurrent financial management methodologies are still imperfect, poorly adapted and \nfar from standardised.  \n− Although the most committed players assess their climate risks more specifically \naccording to the 2015 Paris Climate Conference 2°C objective, and exclusion \nprocedures are widespread across large volumes of assets (specifically targeting \ncontroversial companies and the tobacco industry), the deployment of true low-carbon \nallocation strategies is confined to a very small number of players and impact \nmeasurement remains currently limited.  \n− The coverage ratio of ESG analysis of the portfolios has increased, mainly from the \nassessments made by management companies and specialised rating agencies (see \nSection 3.8).  \n \niii. \nThe green investing sector is adopting market-standard practices: (a) the green bond \nmarket is growing (by volume, liquidity, and diversification across sectors and \ngeographies) and new frameworks are being introduced (taxonomies, principles and \nstandards), (b) green investment funds are gaining traction, and (c) new service and \ninformation providers are emerging (rating agencies, analysts, index providers, reporting \nand data management tool developers).  \nThe responsible investing sector is enjoying strong growth, buoyed by rising demand for \nsocially and environmentally responsible portfolios that deliver a performance profile that is \ndistinctive from conventional investments. 148 \n \n \n                                                           \n147 The task force also notes the diversity of studies published in 2018 on the ESG analysis of French investors - \nincluding these by EY, Indefi and Beyond Ratings. Most of the lessons learned from these studies are confirmed \nfor the most part by each other and reflect the first government assessment of the application of article 173-VI of \nthe LTECV (forthcoming publication). \n148 Refer, for example, to the study published by Deloitte in April 2019 entitled: \"Investors and Responsible \nInvesting: How do investors and advisors view responsible investing in 2019? «. \n\n-151- \n \nResponsible investing: what it means and how it is growing  \nIn the course of its interviews, the task force observed a series of trends that shed important \nlight on the key role that extra-financial information is playing in the growth of sustainable \nfinance:  \n Socially responsible investing is gaining popularity:  \n \nIt is important to point out, at this juncture, that responsible investing is a fluid, constantly \nevolving concept that means different things to different investors – from exclusion lists to \nstakeholder engagement, and everything in between (for instance, giving due weight to \npositive and negative externalities through improved financial management practices, or \nfactoring ESG dimensions into investment decisions).  \n \nSo-called “positive” responsible investing involves one of three strategies149:  \n \ni. \n“Best in class”: investing in those companies that set the gold standard for sustainability \nwithin a given sector or industry (without necessarily excluding any sectors or \nindustries); \n \nii. \n“Best in universe”: selecting and weighting the best-performing investments within a \nuniverse (here, contrary to the “best in class” strategy, investors may exclude particular \nsectors or industries on the basis of inadequate ESG performance); \n \niii. \n“Best effort”: investing only in those companies that have made the most “effort” on \nsustainability issues (i.e. not necessarily the “best in universe” on ESG performance).  \nIn addition, ESG integration happens to differing degrees. In some cases, ESG analysis is \nmade available to mainstream analysts and fund managers, but no standardised process exists \n(known as “non-systematic ESG integration”). In other cases, ESG analysis is systematically \nconsidered by fund managers and analysts. And in other cases still, the conventional \nmanagement process includes mandatory investment constraints.  \n \nThe task force observed a diverse range of practices among asset managers, as well as \nmarked differences in institutional investors’ investment and asset-allocation policies.  \n \n \nSource: Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, Responsible Investing Policy, September 2017.150 \nThe task force’s interviews revealed that, while demand for responsible financial products is \ngrowing, it remains very much a niche market – not least because, by law, financial advisers \n                                                           \n149 It should be highlighted that behind these different practices, the task force noted the absence of a full and \ncomplete comparison between funds, which are built on different methodologies and with different degrees of \nmaturity. \n150 \nAvailable \nonline \nat: \nhttps://www.edmond-de-rothschild.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/asset-\nmanagement/isr/EDRAM-responsible-investment-policy.pdf  \n\n-152- \n \nare under no obligation to obtain information (from retail or institutional investors) about \nportfolio performance expectations (unless the investor is demonstrably risk-averse).  \nIn any event, ESG integration differs across asset classes. For fixed-income products, risk is \nassessed at a fixed point in time. For stocks, meanwhile, there is a greater emphasis on future \ncash flows (i.e. a forward-looking approach). Moreover, complex temporal, sectoral and \ngeographical considerations make it difficult for managers to allocate multi-asset funds \nstrategically.  \n \nFor example, in an effort to circumvent these problems, Sycomore Asset Management (met \nby the task-force, has made developed with BNP Paribas, I-Care & Consult and Quantis two \nproprietary responsible investing methods:  \n The Net Environmental Contribution (NEC) metric, launched in 2017, measures the \nextent to which businesses are aligned with the ecological and energy transition and with \nglobal warming targets. Intended for both retail and institutional investors, it produces a \nscore ranging from -100% (for business that are highly damaging to natural capital) to \n+100% (for companies with a strong positive net impact, offering clear solutions to \nenvironmental and climate-related challenges). The NEC metric draws on over 200 \ndatabases, studies and labels (from government and environmental agencies, think tanks \nand NGOs) and considers the full life cycle of products and services.  \n \n The SPICE fundamental analysis model (internally used at Sycomore Asset Management) \nuses a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria to measure how a company creates value \nfor each of the five stakeholders that it covers (Suppliers & Society, People, Investors, \nClients, Environment). The model influences risk premium and target prices as calculated \nby the firm’s analysts. \n \nSource: Report published on 30 June 2018 relating to the asset management company Sycomore AM and \ncomplying with the requirements of Art. 173-VI of the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act.151 \n                                                           \n151 https://en.sycomore-am.com/5be1c5f9-Sycoway_as_an_Investor_UK_web.pdf  \n\n-153- \n \nBased on the information gathered during the interviews, the task force believes that the \nbest practices outlined above should form the basis of ESG integration going forward.  \nMore generally, responsible investing is enjoying buoyant growth in France. Financial \nand extra-financial analysts are increasingly merging to form new investment management \ncompanies, many companies are deciding to become 100% SRI, and there is a general trend \ntowards establishing common methodological frameworks. The interviewees were keen to \nstress that France’s financial sector should remain in the driving seat.  \n Stock exchanges are leading from the front, especially in the European Union, through \nboth unilateral measures and joint initiatives such as the International Network of \nFinancial Centres for Sustainability which, until 2020, will be co-chaired by France \n(Finance for Tomorrow) and China (Shanghai Green Finance Committee).  \n \nAt Euronext, the euro area’s largest stock exchange, the General Counsel is responsible \nfor overseeing group ESG policy and keeping the group’s Managing Board informed \nabout ESG initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2018, a new ESG Task Force was created to \nsupport the General Counsel and develop the group’s ESG strategy. In the same year, \naccording to its registration document filed with the Netherlands Authority for the \nFinancial Markets (AFM), Euronext also launched a pan-European stakeholder \nconsultation process to identify the most relevant ESG-related issues that should inform \nits ESG strategy in 2019 and beyond (inviting contributions from advisory committees, \nclients, shareholders, analysts, investors, regulators, NGOs, and more). In 2008, Euronext \njoined forces with global experts and NGOs to become the first stock exchange to launch \na pan-European CO2 emissions index – the Low Carbon 100 Europe, which represents the \n100 sector and industry leaders with the lowest carbon emissions.

These views drew on the speakers’ experiences of financial auditing – a vital part \nof the information quality assurance process. Although financial auditing has faced its own \nchallenges, and undergone a series of reforms, its principles are now set in stone: \n \n Modern-day financial auditing practice has developed over the course of more than a \ncentury. Its underlying principles – who is involved in the process and what roles they \nplay, what methods are used, how auditors work, and what their responsibilities are – have \nbeen reworked and refined with the passage of time. Often, changes to these principles \nhave come at times of crisis, when it has become clear, among other things, that financial \naudits should provide an even greater degree of assurance. \n \n The past 20 years have seen two waves of reform. The first, in the early 2000s, came in \nthe wake of a series of financial scandals (most notably the collapse of Worldcom and \nParmalat, and the Enron scandal, which saw one of the world’s biggest companies go \nbankrupt and sparked a tightening of regulations in the United States155 and worldwide156). \nThe second wave occurred in the late 2010s, when the subprime mortgage crisis brought \nthe global financial system to the brink of collapse, prompting the EU to reform its audit \nrules157 (rules which Member States have transposed into domestic law in recent years).158 \nContrary to appearances, these waves of reform were not about casting doubt on the value \nof auditing as a principle, but rather about a necessary shift in emphasis from auditing as a \ncontractual to a public-interest exercise. Current debates in the United Kingdom159 suggest \nthat this shift remains an ongoing process, and that the current rules could well be \nbolstered further in the interest of better assurance. Financial auditing nevertheless \nremains a vital link in the assurance chain. \n \n The financial audit is the penultimate link in the quality and materiality assurance chain \nfor financial disclosures (before regulatory oversight). The audit happens at the very end \nof the financial statement preparation process. Up until this point, the entire process is \nhandled in-house. The audit is an external exercise, although the auditor has unrestricted \naccess to the company and its information systems.  \n \n                                                           \n155 The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(PCAOB). \n156 In France: the 2003 Financial Security Act and the creation of the Haut Conseil du Commissariat aux \nComptes (High Council of the Order of Statutory Auditors, H3C). \n157 Regulation 2014/537/EU and Directive 2014/56/EU (April 2014). \n158 In France: ordinance no. 2016-315 of 17 March 2016. \n159 Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) report of 18 April 2019, and potential reform of the Financial \nReporting Council (FRC). \n\n-157- \n \n In other words, the audit comes after all the other, clearly identified links in the quality \nassurance chain: \n \n− a high-quality, credible and sufficiently well-recognised framework of reporting rules \nand principles  \n− effective information systems and robust internal control procedures for the \npreparation of financial disclosures  \n− a governance body that takes accountability for the company’s disclosures, after \nconsulting the external auditors \n \n A financial audit is an exercise in which a qualified, independent third party (an auditor) \nexamines a body of information and expresses a reasoned conclusion based on that \nevidence. Its primary purpose is to ascertain whether a company’s financial statements \nhave been prepared regularly and sincerely, and whether they give a “fair representation” \nof the company’s performance. By extension, most financial audits also cover financial \ninformation in its broadest sense, as included in the management report, registration \ndocument, and other reports and documents prepared by the company. In some cases, the \nauditors will also check whether the company has complied with certain legal obligations. \n \n Auditing standards are the culmination of a global standardisation process – one that \nbegan within the profession160 but has since gained credibility through supervision by \npublic authorities.161 Country-specific versions of the standards have been written into \nappropriate legal and regulatory frameworks,162 and governments have sought to clarify \nthe remit and status of auditors on more than one occasion.  \n \n Historically, the development of auditing standards has followed a similar trajectory to \nthat of accounting standards. The IASC163 (known as the IASB since the early 2000s, \nwhen it was placed under the authority of the IFRS Foundation) was founded in 1973. It \nwas behind the accounting standard-setting and international harmonisation drive that has \nmade the IFRS standards so successful today. The movement has its origins within the \naccounting profession, which felt the need to develop a robust accounting framework and \nto more clearly define how auditors work and the terms of their engagement. The nature \nof auditing changed when early voluntary initiatives gave way to formal obligations, at \nwhich point auditing shifted from being a contractual to a public-interest exercise under \ngovernment supervision. \n \n                                                           \n160 The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), an independent standard-setting body \nsupported by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), a non-profit organisation established in 1977 \nunder Swiss law and headquartered in New York. \n161 Supervision by the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB), a foundation established in 2005 under Spanish \nlaw, itself supervised by the Monitoring Group, which appoints PIOB members. The members of the Monitoring \nGroup are: the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the World Bank, the Financial Stability \nBoard, and the European Commission. \n162 In the EU, by the Audit Directive (Directive 2014/56/EU of 17 May 2006, amended by Directive 2014/56/EU \nof 16 April 2014). Art. 26(2) reads as follows: “For the purposes of paragraph 1, “international auditing \nstandards” means International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC \n1) and other related Standards issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) through the \nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), in so far as they are relevant to the statutory \naudit.” \n163 International Accounting Standards Committee. \n\n-158- \n \n The IAASB’s International Framework for Assurance Engagements164 divides standards \ninto three main categories: \n \n International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) \n International Standards on Review Engagements (ISREs) \n International Standards on Assurance Engagements (ISAEs). \n \nStandards in the first two categories concern financial information (auditing and review of \nfinancial statements). The third category, which includes the ISAE 3000 (Revised)165 \nstandard, concerns assurance exercises other than auditing and review of financial \ninformation. This category includes extra-financial information. While assurance is a \ncommon feature of all three categories, the normative structure makes a clear, if somewhat \nartificial, distinction between financial auditing and review (financial statements), and \nother assurance exercises (other forms of reporting). \n \nIn the past 15 years, financial audit standard-setting bodies have branched out into \nextra-financial standards \n The IAASB’s first extra-financial standard, ISAE 3000, was adopted in 2005 in response \nto growing demand within the profession for a framework covering non-financial audit \nand review exercises. The standard, which applies to “assurance engagements other than \naudits or reviews of historical financial information”, is broad in scope and is defined by \nwhat it does not (as opposed to what it does) cover. \n \n ISAE 3000 (Revised), adopted several years later, introduced a series of improvements, \nalthough the basis remained the same. Like its predecessor, the revised version is similar \nin approach to financial audit and review standards (ISAs and ISREs). While the \nstandard provides a framework for extra-financial audit and review engagements, \ncertain aspects remain necessarily generic because the landscape continues to evolve \nat such a rapid pace: \n \n− The rules follows a similar pattern to other standards in areas such as acceptance of the \nengagement, assurance skills and techniques, ethical requirements, obtaining evidence, \nmateriality, and reporting formats. In that sense the standard takes its cues from ISAs \n(which apply to financial information), transposing the relevant rules with only minor \nalterations. \n− Two key aspects of the standard are generic, however. The first concerns how it \ndefines “subject matter information”. Here, ISAE 3000 cannot draw on ISAs or ISREs \nbecause these have a narrow, clearly delimited focus (financial statements). Instead, \nthe standard allows for much greater breadth, merely requiring that the “subject matter \ninformation” be defined in the engagement letter, or by law or regulation. The second \nrelates to the “criteria” against which subject matter information is verified, and \nwhether those criteria are suitable (“suitability of the criteria”).166 Given the sheer \n                                                           \n164 Adopted in 2005. \n165 Original standard adopted in 2005, revised version adopted in December 2013. \n166 “The criteria that the practitioner expects to be applied in the preparation of the subject matter information \n[…] exhibit the following characteristics: a. Relevance. b. Completeness. c. Reliability. d. Neutrality. e. \nUnderstandability.” \n\n-159- \n \nnumber of frameworks that exist, and that fact that many are idiosyncratic or lack \ndetail, the standard emphasises two key principles: transparency and professional \njudgement. \n− ISAE 3000 also follows exactly the same model as financial audit and review \nstandards on the conclusion that auditors are expected to express, offering two options: \n“reasonable assurance” or “limited assurance”. The key point here is that the \nstandard treats extra-financial information in almost exactly the same way as \nfinancial information for audit and assurance purposes – an ambitious aim given \nthat extra-financial reporting is an innovative and constantly evolving discipline. In \nthat sense, ISAE 3000 represents a deliberate move towards standardisation. \n \n Since 2016, the IAASB – with that same purpose in mind – has continued its efforts to \nbetter characterise the extra-financial information covered by assurance engagements: \n \n− In a 2016 discussion paper167, the IAASB acknowledged the inherent properties of \nextra-financial information and identified 10 key challenges that practitioners face in \ntheir everyday work. These included the complexity of determining the scope of an \nengagement, evaluating the suitability of criteria in a consistent manner, addressing \nmateriality with little guidance, and obtaining assurance with respect to narrative and \nfuture-oriented information. \n− In early 2019, the IAASB opened a second consultation on “Extended External \nReporting (EER) Assurance”,168 with the stated objective of publishing guidance for \npractitioners (as opposed to amending ISAE 3000 (Revised) or introducing a new \nstandard). In its Consultation Paper, the IAASB recognises that “EER” is a broad \nconcept, and that EER audit and review engagements cover disclosures that are \nseparate from financial statements: “EER encapsulates many different forms of \nreporting, including, but not limited to, integrated reporting, sustainability reporting \nand other reporting by entities about environmental, social and governance matters”. \nThe two-stage consultation process is expected to run until end-2020. \n− One noteworthy section of the Consultation Paper is the IAASB’s “Four Key Factor \nModel for Credibility and Trust in relation to EER”:  \ni. \nSound EER Framework  \nii. \nStrong Governance  \niii. \nConsistent Wider Information  \niv. \nExternal Professional Services and Other Reports. \n \n Standardisation initiatives are ongoing in the European Union as Member States \nimplement the Non-Financial Reporting Directive: \n \n− In France, the National Company of Auditors published December 2018 technical \nguidance169 detailing what checks auditors should perform on the Statement on Extra-\nFinancial Performance (part of the management report). The guidance distinguishes \nbetween two sets of circumstances. In all cases, the statutory auditor is legally required \nto check: (i) that the statement is present (by “reading” it), (ii) that the statement \ncovers the subjects required by law, and (iii) that the statement is consistent with the \n                                                           \n167 IAASB Discussion Paper, Supporting Credibility and Trust in Emerging Forms of External Reporting \n168 IAASB Consultation Paper, Extended External Reporting (EER) Assurance, February 2019. The consultation \ncloses on 21 June 2019. \n169 National Company of Auditors (CNCC), Avis technique : Déclaration de performance extra-financière. \nIntervention du commissaire aux comptes- Intervention de l’OTI. \n\n-160- \n \nfinancial statements and that the financial information it contains is sincere.170 In this \ncase, the statutory auditor’s engagement comes under the NEP 9510 standard.171 If the \nstatutory auditor (or one of the statutory auditors) is also the independent third-party \norganisation required by law,172 it must conduct further checks (detailed in the \ntechnical guidance) in the spirit of the ISAE 3000 (Revised) standard, and express a \nlimited-assurance conclusion in a separate report. \n− In Germany, the law allows an issuer to choose where to publish its Statement on \nExtra-Financial Performance: in its management report (as a standalone section or \ndispersed throughout the report), in a separate report, or on its website no later than \nfour months after publishing its management report. In most cases, the independent \nthird-party organisation merely confirms that the Statement on Extra-Financial \nPerformance exists. If, however, the statement is dispersed throughout the \nmanagement report, it normally expresses a reasonable-assurance conclusion.  \n \n These developments show that, while much work has gone into building an extra-financial \naudit and review framework, there are inherent problems that cannot be overlooked: \n \n− The standards are intended for accountants. Yet, even where the standards recommend \nor allow for independent third-party verification, accountants cannot claim a \nmonopoly because, in practice, reviews and audits are typically performed by multi-\ndisciplinary teams. \n− A lack of standardisation in extra-financial information means that audit and review \nstandards remain necessarily generic – and of limited practical use. There is a strong \nargument to suggest that, in the coming years, audit and review standards will need to \nevolve in parallel with frameworks governing the substance and format of extra-\nfinancial reporting. \n− Lastly, extra-financial assurance is still a largely optional exercise, meaning that \nengagements are performed by relatively small teams of specialist practitioners (unlike \nfinancial audit teams). \n \n Initiatives have come from outside the accounting profession, too. For instance, \nAFNOR173 has published a “Guide on performing the checks required by Art. L.225-102-\n1 of the French Commercial Code”. The guide,174 which was drawn up in the usual way \nand on a consensus basis by AFNOR’s sustainability and social responsibility \nstandardisation committee, explains how to check the Statement on Extra-Financial \nPerformance and is intended primarily for companies and independent third-party \norganisations. The guide sets out how the exercise should be conducted, goes into detail \non certain specific checks, and recommends that practitioners express a negative-\nassurance conclusion (based on the limited-assurance model). \n \n \n                                                           \n170 Avis technique. Section 3.12, final paragraph. \n171 Norme d’Exercice Professionnel (NEP) 9510 (November 2018, replacing the 2009 standard), Diligences du \ncommissaire aux comptes relatives au rapport de gestion, aux autres documents sur la situation financière et les \ncomptes et aux informations relevant du rapport sur le gouvernement d’entreprise adressés aux membres de \nl’organe appelé à statuer sur les comptes. NEP 9510 is a version of the international ISA 720 standard adapted \nto the legislative and regulatory context in France. \n172 Checks by an independent third-party organisation are required for companies with a balance-sheet total or \nrevenue in excess of €100 million, or with more than 50 employees. \n173 French Association for Standardisation \n174 FD X 30-024 January 2019, which updates and replaces FD X 30-024 October 2016. \n\n-161- \n \nVerifying extra-financial information: a technically challenging exercise \n As outlined earlier in this report, the first challenge facing practitioners stems from the \nfact that extra-financial reporting frameworks are not stabilised (in form or \nsubstance). Financial auditors can rely on comprehensive, detailed and mandatory \naccounting standards. Moreover, any options provided for in those standards are both \nlimited and written into the standards themselves. The same cannot be said for extra-\nfinancial frameworks. Companies have a much wider choice of reporting options, and \npractitioners are expected to exercise professional judgement as to how those decisions \nhave been made. \n \n The second challenge has to do with the sheer diversity of information that practitioners \nare expected to check: \n \n− Extra-financial disclosures combine both qualitative and quantitative information. \nSince qualitative information is by nature largely subjective, practitioners can only \ncheck whether issuers’ disclosures are consistent, exhaustive and neutral, and are \ntypically restricted to expressing limited-assurance (as opposed to reasonable-\nassurance) conclusions. Moreover, qualitative disclosures fall into two separate \ncategories: those expressed in monetary units, and those expressed as non-monetary \nmetrics (such as staffing numbers, time, or surface area). And while quantitative \ndisclosures lend themselves to more “objective” verification, they too can be divided \ninto sub-categories (in this case, three):  \ni. \nQuasi-financial information expressed in monetary values that, while not \nincluded in a company’s financial statements, comes from the same systems. \nAuditors check these disclosures in a similar way to financial statements, and are \nable to express reasonable-assurance conclusions on their findings.  \nii. \nManagement information expressed as non-monetary metrics. In well-\norganised companies, these disclosures normally come from information systems \nthat are integrated with accounting systems. Here, the challenge is twofold. First, \nauditors cannot verify the information on the same, stable basis as financial \ndisclosures. And second, because this type of information tends to be less \nrigorous than financial and quasi-financial information, it demands a specific set \nof auditing procedures. Even so, auditors are able to express reasonable-\nassurance conclusions about disclosures falling to this category. \niii. \nApproximate information, normally expressed as non-monetary metrics and \nbased on benchmarks, extrapolations or statistical approaches (professional \nor otherwise). This is the hardest type of information to verify because the \ncompany itself does not have an accurate picture of the metrics it is disclosing \nand is reliant on the reliability of other information sources. In this case, because \nauditors have no choice but to refer to external evidence, their conclusion is \nnecessarily nuanced. \n− Likewise, there is an important distinction between historical and forward-looking \ninformation. While auditors can use observable, verifiable evidence and indicators to \ncheck historical information, forward-looking disclosures are qualitative because, in \nmost cases, they take the form of forecasts or commitments. Even for quantitative \nforward-looking information, auditors can only check whether the figures are \nconsistent, exhaustive and neutral – and are unlikely to be able to give the same degree \nof assurance from one disclosure to the next. \n \n\n-162- \n \n− As the above analysis demonstrates, there is an important dividing line to be drawn \nbetween financial information (about which auditors can express reasonable-assurance \nconclusions), and extra-financial information (which lends itself merely to limited-\nassurance conclusions).  \nExtra-financial auditing: clear demand, a move towards standardisation, but still a \ntechnically challenging, largely optional and marginal practice \n In most cases, companies elect to have their extra-financial disclosures audited on an \noptional basis: \n \n− The European Union, which is known for its pioneering approach to extra-financial \ninformation, has retained a more conservative stance on external auditing – a fact laid \nbare in recital 16 in the preamble to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive: “Statutory \nauditors and audit firms should only check that the non-financial statement or the \nseparate report has been provided. In addition, it should be possible for Member States \nto require that the information included in the non-financial statement or in the \nseparate report be verified by an independent assurance services provider.” Art. 19a \nand Art. 29a(5-6) of the Directive are drafted in a similar spirit. The statutory auditor \nmerely checks that the Statement on Extra-Financial Performance is included in the \nmanagement report.175 Whether or not the auditor verifies the substance of the report is \nleft to individual Member States’ discretion. \n− This conservative stance may well be down to the fact that the EU is wary of pushing \nforward too quickly in what remains an experimental discipline. Nevertheless, some \nMember States – especially France, Spain and Italy – have pressed ahead with making \nindependent third-party verification a mandatory requirement. In France, Art. L.225-\n102-1(V) of the French Commercial Code states that extra-financial information “shall \nbe audited by an independent third-party organisation” and that the audit “shall lead to \nan opinion that is sent to the meeting of shareholders” at the same time as the \nmanagement report. Art. R.225-102-1 states that the independent third-party \norganisation must be accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (COFRAC), \nmust be independent, must describe what checks it has performed, and must issue a \n“reasoned opinion” as to whether the statement complies with Art. R.225-105(I) and \nArt. R.225-105(II), and whether the disclosures are sincere pursuant to Art. R.225-\n105(I)(3) and Art. R.225-105(II). These requirements apply only to the Statement on \nExtra-Financial Performance. Checks of other reports remain optional. The statutory \nauditor may act as the independent third-party organisation, provided that it is \naccredited.176 \n− Outside the European Union, audits tend to be optional and the obligations are largely \ngeneric in nature. \n \n It stands to reason that, where audits are optional, only a handful of companies \nwillingly have their extra-financial information externally verified. However, many \nissuers told the task force that, even where frameworks were lacking, having their \nextra-financial disclosures externally audited had helped them become more \nrigorous and consistent in their reporting – and made their disclosures more reliable \nand material. \n \n                                                           \n175 French Commercial Code, Art. L823-10(4). \n176 25 of the 29 accredited independent third-party organisations are statutory auditors. \n\n-163- \n \n3.7 Regulators and supervisors: a potential supporting role at the post-\nreporting stage \nGiven that extra-financial reporting is still an emerging discipline, and that most requirements \nare non-binding in nature, regulatory and supervisory authorities lack teeth and tend to \nplay only a bit-part role at the post-reporting stage. \n \nDespite this, some European and global regulators and supervisors are taking a more \nactive interest in extra-financial reporting, albeit on a limited basis at this stage:   \n IOSCO’s Committee on Issuer Accounting, Audit and Disclosure, which is co-chaired by \nJapan’s Financial Services Agency and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \n(and which counts the AMF’s Corporate Accounting Director among its members), has \nsharpened its focus on extra-financial reporting: \nIn January 2019, IOSCO published a “Statement on Disclosure of ESG Matters by \nIssuers”, in which it highlights the need for issuers to integrate ESG matters into their \nstrategy and reporting, and sets out what the organisation (and its Sustainable Finance \nNetwork in particular) is currently doing on this front:  \n \n“IOSCO encourages issuers to consider the materiality of ESG matters to their business \nand to assess risks and opportunities in light of their business strategy and risk \nassessment methodology. When ESG matters are considered to be material, issuers should \ndisclose the impact or potential impact on their financial performance and value creation. \nIn doing so, issuers also are encouraged to give insight to the governance and oversight \nof ESG-related material risks. Issuers can provide such insight, for example, by disclosing \nthe methodologies they follow in their risk assessment, and the steps taken, and/or action \nplans developed, to address the risks that they have identified. The information provided \nby issuers should be balanced and should consider and reflect both risks and \nopportunities presented by material ESG matters. IOSCO reminds issuers that \ninformation disclosed outside of securities filings following a voluntary disclosure \nframework may also be required to be disclosed under security filings if it is material. \n[…] IOSCO furthermore encourages issuers to clearly disclose the framework(s) that they \nhave used (if any) in preparing and disclosing material ESG information.”  \n \nHowever, the organisation currently has around 200 members (including most national \nregulators, plus international institutions, stock exchanges, clearing houses and other \nbodies), and, since 2017, the United States has remained staunchly opposed to ambitious \ninitiatives. For those reasons, IOSCO is unlikely to make significant progress towards \na common, international standard in the near term. \n \n At ESMA, meanwhile, extra-financial reporting continues to rise up the agenda, not least \nas a consequence of ongoing work on the European Commission Action Plan on \nSustainable Finance: \nThe following statement comes from ESMA’s 2019 Annual Work Programme: \n“Considering the increasing relevance of sustainability issues, ESMA will closely monitor \nthe developments in this area and promote the creation of a common supervisory culture \nwith regards to non-financial reporting”. \n \n\n-164- \n \nOn 26 October 2018, ESMA published details of the priorities that enforcers will consider \nwhen examining 2018 financial statements (the same year that the Statement on Extra-\nFinancial Performance was introduced). In its statement, ESMA said: “In addition to the \ncommon enforcement priorities [….], ESMA highlights specific requirements relating to \nthe sections of the annual financial report other than the financial statements […] These \ninclude the requirements with regards to the disclosure of non-financial information \nwith particular focus on: environmental and climate change-related matters, \nexplanation as to why certain policies were not pursued; and key performance indicators \nrelating to non-financial policies.”  \n \nESMA therefore requires full transparency on extra-financial reporting methodology, \nand on the scope that disclosures cover (especially on environmental and climate \nchange-related matters). It also expects issuers to use KPIs that are consistent with their \ninternal control and risk assessment metrics, and to explain any changes from one year to \nthe next.  \n \nESMA has set up a Narrative Reporting Working Group, within its Corporate Reporting \nStanding Committee, to develop and promote common supervisory approaches and \npractices on extra-financial information disclosures and alternative performance measures. \nIn 2019, the new working group will focus on exchanging experiences with a view to \nfuture harmonisation of supervisory practices on extra-financial reporting.  \n \nESMA’s current priorities are twofold: to encourage more issuers to disclose extra-\nfinancial information, and to harmonise supervisory practices on extra-financial reporting. \nThe second priority is a longer-term ambition, given regulatory divergence and differing \ndegrees of political engagement on the subject across EU Member States (including \namong financial regulators and supervisors).  \n \nIn all of the non-EU countries that the task force examined, regulators and supervisors also \nintervene almost exclusively at the post-reporting stage – especially in the United States and \nJapan (although, here, regulators are taking an increasingly active stance) (see Appendix 9).  \n \nIn France, the AMF’s position at the end of the reporting chain means that its role is \nconfined to reviewing corporate reporting practices. At present, it has no power to \nsanction firms who engage in sub-standard practices. In its strategic plan, however, the \nauthority makes clear that it supports companies publishing more extra-financial information \nand intends to play a supporting role in that process: \n \n The AMF’s role is to observe and review practices as issuers come to grips with new \nperiodic reporting requirements (i.e. issuers must now include a Statement on Extra-\nFinancial Performance in their management report, and all companies, listed or otherwise, \nmust publish a corporate governance report – a requirement under the ordinance of 12 \nJuly 2017 – classified as “regulated information” under Art. 221-1 of the AMF General \nRegulation). In 2016, the AMF published a report on social, societal and environmental \nresponsibility in 2016 (and will likely publish a second such report by end-2019), as well \nas a report on corporate governance and executive remuneration. \n \n In its 2016 report on social, societal and environmental responsibility, the authority \nexamined the extra-financial information disclosed by a sample of 60 listed companies \n\n-165- \n \n(including 30 SMEs and mid-caps) in their 2015177 registration documents. It found that \nall listed firms, regardless of size, were devoting increasingly more time and resources to \nextra-financial reporting, and developing new systems to track their performance. The \nAMF further concluded that, beyond regulatory aspects, companies were more committed \nto long-term targets, using clearer and more relevant indicators and, in some cases, \nchoosing to provide information that includes both financial and extra-financial data.  \n \n Based on its findings, the AMF made four recommendations – a deliberately limited \nnumber given that 2016 was a pivotal year from a regulatory perspective (entry into force \nof Art. 173 of the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act, and transposition of the \nEuropean Directive): (i) increase the relevance of non-financial information, (ii) fuller \naccount of the role of CSR in the company’s strategy; (iii) reflect on ways to present \nfinancial and non-financial information coherently (the AMF favours an approach that \npromotes greater integration), and (iv) improve disclosure with respect to green bonds \nissuance.  \nThe task force also learned that the AMF is currently finalising ambitious guidance on \nextra-financial reporting, reflecting EU-wide initiatives on sustainable finance and placing \nparticular emphasis on reporting. The guidance is designed to help users make sense of a \ngrowing body of private initiatives and, drawing on the accumulated experience of European \nissuers and investment managers, map out a trajectory towards a more robust, unified \nEuropean extra-financial reporting framework (for climate-related matters and beyond).  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n177 The task force notes that the AMF will publish its next report on CSR by the end of 2019. \n\n-166- \n \n3.8 Extra-financial rating: a useful if challenging exercise \nExtra-financial rating looks beyond a company or state’s financial metrics to ascertain how it \nperforms on environmental, social and governance aspects. Although the practice is gaining \nground, it is not without its difficulties: data is in short supply, ratings are hard to compare \nfrom one agency to the next, and rating methods are still evolving. These problems aside, the \ngrowth of extra-financial rating is placing immense strain on companies, forcing them to \ndisclose more information in ever more complex reports.  \n \nPost-2000 consolidation: conventional index providers, rating agencies and proxy \nadvisory firms have branched out into extra-financial rating \nThe increasing burden of ESG reporting has given rise to a lucrative market for extra-\nfinancial rating agencies, with steep growth since the early 2000s. The sector has undergone a \nstring of consolidation phases, especially during the recent financial crisis, and the number of \nfirms has contracted sharply in the past few years, reaching an apparent point of stability. The \nmarket nevertheless remains fiercely competitive, as providers continue to launch an ever \nmore diverse range of products and services.  \n \nRating agencies can broadly be divided into two categories: generalists such as Vigeo Eiris, \nMSCI ESG Research, Sustainalytics and Oekom), and specialists like Ethifinance (SMEs), \nSouth Pole (carbon footprint), Trucost (environmental impact assessment) and ISS-Ethix \n(norm-based exclusion and controversial industries).  \n \nMore often than not, generalist firms have their roots in mergers, acquisitions and alliances \nbetween established market participants in the 1990s, at a time when rating agencies struggled \nto build financially viable businesses and sought greater independence from the companies \nthey were assessing: \n \n Vigeo Eiris: the 2002 takeover of Arese (France’s first social and environmental \nperformance assessment body), a 2005 alliance with Belgian agency Ethibel, the takeover \nof Italian firm Avanzi SRI Research, and a merger with British agency Ethical Investment \nResearch Service (Eiris, founded in 1983); \n \n Sustainalytics: the 2008 merger of several SIRI Company entities (Sostenibilidad, Dutch \nSustainability Research and Scoris); \n \n MSCI ESG Research: the 2010 takeover of RiskMetrics by index provider Morgan \nStanley Capital International (MSCI), which had previously acquired proxy advisory firm \nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS) in 2007 and two U.S.-based extra-financial rating \nagencies in 2009. MSCI ESG Research acquired U.S. agency GMI Ratings in 2014, and \nprivate equity firm Genstar Capital bought out ISS in 2017.  \nA second consolidation wave began in 2015, when ISS acquired Swedish agency Ethix SRI \nAdvisors. The main drivers behind this second wave have been credit rating agencies \n(Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s), proxy advisory firm ISS, and investment research \nspecialist Morningstar.  \n \n\n-167- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTwo trends underpin this consolidation process:  \n \n Established financial data providers and conventional rating agencies have \nincreasingly looked to branch out into extra-financial rating – a trend that \ndemonstrates both the importance of ESG analysis for market participants, and the \nsymbiotic relationship between the disciplines of financial and extra-financial rating.  \n \n U.S. firms have come to dominate the extra-financial rating market, which was once \nan almost exclusively European affair – a trend that underscores both Europe’s industry-\nleading expertise and the fact that European firms have struggled to build viable, \nstandalone business models for reasons of geography and synergy.  \nIn March 2019, Beyond Ratings – the first issuer of sovereign, public finance and \ninstitutional ratings to systematically include ESG aspects in its criteria – was accredited by \nESMA, becoming the only firm of its type out of 28 credit rating agencies recognised by the \nauthority.  \n \nExtra-financial rating agencies: diverse services, equally diverse methods  \nExtra-financial rating agencies assess companies using information from two sources: \nissuers themselves, and the public domain. Assessment methods differ from one agency to \nthe next, although the underlying principles remain the same:  \n \n Agencies assess companies’ (or, in the case of Beyond Ratings, public entities’) ESG \nperformance against a string of criteria (such as energy use, workplace accidents, or \ngreenhouse gas emissions) and various standards, most of which are international and \nlargely generic in nature (such as ILO Conventions, or the Ten Principles of the UN \nGlobal Compact).  \n \n For each ESG criterion, an agency will look at what policies the company pursues, how it \nactions those policies, how effective those actions are, and how it reports on its \nperformance. The agency then calculates an overall score, allowing investors to compare \ncompanies’ performance on that particular ESG aspect. The main methodological \n \nCredit rating \nagencies  \n• Moody’s acquires Vigeo Eiris in 2019   \n• Standard & Poor’s acquires Trucost in 2016 \n \nISS (proxy \nadvisory \nfirm)  \n• ISS acquires Ethix SRI Advisors in 2015 \n• ISS acquires South Pole Group in 2017 \n• ISS acquires Oekom in 2018 \n \nMorningstar \n(investment \nresearch) \n• Morningstar acquires Sustainalytics in 2017 \n\n-168- \n \ndifferences between sectors (and, for that matter, between agencies) stem from which \ncriteria are selected, and how the weighting systems work.  \n \n In the first instance, agencies assess companies against recognised standards (international \nprinciples and frameworks, typically the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, which \ncover key ESG aspects) and known controversies (monitoring various sources for \nevidence of involvement in controversial activities), before subsequently drilling down \ninto more detail about the company’s ESG risks, policies and performance.  \n \n Many agencies also offer shareholder engagement services (especially ISS, which was \noriginally a proxy advisory firm), as well as investment research services. Other agencies, \nsuch as Vigeo Eiris and Sustainalytics, provide green bond issuance consulting and \nenvironmental and social impact assessment services.  \n \n In the absence of a common framework, agencies have developed proprietary \nmethods, although they have sought to make their rating criteria comparable by drawing \non a relatively standardised set of international standards.  \n \nFrom its interviews with rating agencies, the task force found substantial differences in both \nthe assessment methods and information sources they use: \n \n The table below contains a summary of the practices employed by a sample of rating \nagencies interviewed by the task force178:  \n \n \n                                                           \n178 Nevertheless, it shall be mentioned here that the task force was informed of the methodological particularities \nand services offered by the French rating agency EthiFinance, the European leader for the rating of small and \nmedium-sized companies, both listed and unlisted. In 2017, EthiFinance joined forces with research provider \nSpread Research, registered as a financial rating agency with ESMA and as an External Credit Assessment \nInstitution with the European Banking Agency and the European Insurance and Ocupational Pensions Authority \n(EIOPA).  \n \n\n-169- \n \nRating \nAgency \nMain information \nsources \nRating method \n(summary) \nPaying clients \n \nISS \n- Uses public \ninformation (main \nsource) \n- Sends a draft \nassessment to the \nissuer along with \na questionnaire, \nfollowed by back-\nand-forth \ndiscussions \n- Uses the following standards: ILO (labour \npractices), ISO, GRI (qualitative \nindicators) SASB (industry-specific \nstandards) \n- Considers controversies \n- Does not consider which reporting \nframework(s) the issuer uses, but does \nconsider verification by an independent \nthird-party organisation \n \nIssues a “corporate rating” on a scale \nfrom A+ to D- \nInvestors \nSustainalytics \n- Conducts daily \nscreening of press \narticles for \nevidence of \ninvolvement in \ncontroversial \nactivities (this \nforms the basis of \nvalue chain \nevaluation and \nrisk assessment) \n- Examines \npublished reports, \nthen engages in \nback-and-forth \ndiscussion with \nthe company \n- Uses historical information to produce a \nforward-looking analysis  \n- ESG rating founded on three “building \nblocks”:  \n(i) corporate governance (governance \nstandards, controversies)  \n(ii) material ESG issues (for the company \nand its sub-industry) \n(iii) idiosyncratic ESG issues \n \nThe ESG rating is based on exposure \nto material ESG risks and how well those \nrisks are managed \nInvestors \nMSCI ESG \nResearch \n- Uses extra-\nfinancial \ninformation \npublished by the \ncompany \n- Sends the \nassessment to the \ncompany and \nengages in back-\nand-forth \ndiscussion \n- Maps ESG risks by sector then assesses \nESG performance using reporting data \n- Does not consider which reporting \nframework(s) the issuer uses in assessing \ndata quality \n \nIssues a rating on a scale from AAA \nto CCC \nInvestors \nTrucost \n- Uses information \npublished by the \ncompany and \nCDP data only  \n- Engages in \nannual back-and-\nforth discussion \nwith the company \n- Uses approximate models (despite the \ninherent problems with approximating \ngovernance risks) that draw on CAPEX \n(investment) and other quantitative data \n- Does not consider which reporting \nframework(s) the issuer uses in assessing \ndata quality \n \nDoes not issue ratings, but instead \nInvestors \n\n-170- \n \nRating \nAgency \nMain information \nsources \nRating method \n(summary) \nPaying clients \n \nquantifies risks (plans to begin issuing \nratings in 2019) \nVigeo Eiris \nUses published \nreports and CDP \ndata \n- Employs a proprietary Equitics method, \nbased on 300 “principles of action” from \ninternational frameworks and standards, to \nassess performance in six areas \n(environment, community involvement, \nbusiness behaviour, human rights, \ncorporate governance and human \nresources) against a set of 38 criteria, \nselected and tailored to specific industries \non the basis of a materiality assessment \n(20-25 criteria “activated” for each \nindustry) \n- Questionnaire covers nine aspects divided \nevenly across three “pillars”: leadership, \nimplementation and results179  \n \nIssues a score on a scale of 0 to 100 \nInvestors and \nissuers \n \n One prominent feature of these rating methods is that they tend to be scalable, allowing \nagencies to build artificial intelligence into their practices (and assess thousands of \ncompanies every year), and to adjust the weighting of different ESG criteria.  \n \n Because extra-financial disclosures lack structure and are difficult to compare, \nagencies \nrely \nheavily \non \nso-called \n“non-corporate” \nextra-financial \ninformation (regulator databases, media, NGO data, raw industry data). The extent to \nwhich they use this type of information differs markedly from one industry to the next.  \n \n In a report entitled “2019 ESG Trends to Watch”, MSCI ESG Research highlights the \ncritical role of alternative data (generated by artificial intelligence systems):  \n \n“ESG investing has been a major beneficiary of this explosion of new data sources. \nLooking back at the past decade […], contextual, alternative data has always been used \nalongside voluntary corporate-disclosure data to assess companies’ exposure to ESG \nrisks. The use of alternative data was necessary because disclosure alone was so sparse \nand could tell investors relatively little about companies’ latent and emerging ESG risks \n[…] The “big data” revolution has allowed investors to become less reliant on voluntary \ncorporate disclosure, as the universe of ESG information from alternative sources \ncontinues to expand at a pace that far exceeds improvements in voluntary disclosure.” \n \n \n \n                                                           \n179 Vigeo Eiris' methodology is relatively more detailed than the methodology of the other agencies met by the \ntask force, in that the task force had access via Vigeo Eiris to detailed information on their rating methodology. \nThis element justifies the higher degree of accuracy within the table.    \n\n-171- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: MSCI ESG Research, 2019 ESG Trends to Watch, January 2019. \n \nRating agencies’ sway over investors: a heavy reporting burden amid information \nscarcity \nAs well as meeting their extra-financial reporting obligations, companies have to complete \nrating agencies’ questionnaires and engage in time-consuming back-and-forth during the \nrating process. There is little overlap between this process and other corporate reporting \nwork:  \n \n A January 2019 study by Medef, Afep, Cliff Investor Relations and the Collège des \nDirecteurs du Développement Durable found that companies were struggling to deal with \nthe sheer range of assessment methods employed by extra-financial rating agencies, and \nthat issuers dealing with one agency had few takeaways they could carry over to the next. \nThe study examined a series of rating agencies and organisations (CDP, EcoVadis, FTSE, \nMSCI, Oekom, RobecoSam, Sustainalytics and Vigeo Eiris), highlighting what each one \ndoes well and where its practices could be improved. Most of the respondents said they \ndealt primarily with two agencies: Vigeo Eiris and CDP.  \n \n The findings highlighted three common problems: completing the questionnaires and \nengaging in back-and-forth with agencies (where it happens) is a time-consuming \nprocess, agencies’ assessment methods are opaque and unstable, and some of the \nassessment criteria (such as engagement in controversial activities) lack transparency. \nMoreover, only around half of the companies that the task force interviewed said they \nactually returned agencies’ questionnaires and answered their queries.    \n \n The study also contains a set of recommendations on the following issues: dealing with \ngovernance and conflicts of interest, making rating methods more transparent (including \nconsideration of whether the issuer uses an industry-specific standard), ensuring that \ncompanies receive a copy of the agency’s report, improving the information-gathering \nprocess (pre-populating questionnaires), allowing the company to review the draft report, \nstabilising rating methods (including, as a bare minimum, providing information upfront \n\n-172- \n \nto help the company plan ahead), considering industry-specific issues, and being more \ntransparent about the implications of involvement in controversial activities.  \n \nIn spite of these problems and grievances, the data that rating agencies collect, and the \nassessments they produce, are a goldmine of information for investors. And while investors \nare shifting to proprietary models in growing number, they continue to hold rating agencies \nin high regard for the sheer breadth of extra-financial information they collect: \n \n While ESG analysts at investment management companies pick their way through the \nminefield of ratings by carrying out their own surveys and assessments, investors are \nincreasingly turning to rating agencies for the information they provide (as opposed to \ntheir ratings per se). \n \n Many investors are placing their trust in a single agency, picking off-the-shelf services, \nopting for custom information packages or other special arrangements, or applying \n“geographical” or other filters that serve their particular interests. Other investors buy in \nservices from multiple generalist and specialist agencies, especially if they are seeking \ninformation on carbon emissions and controversial activities.  \n \n Some investors treat agencies merely as information providers, reprocessing the data – \nwhich typically comes from corporate reports and NGO publications, and often focuses on \nspecific themes such as those mentioned above – before feeding it into their own analysis \nframeworks and weighting systems.  \n \n Others still use proprietary models and bypass rating agencies altogether, preferring \ninstead to work with academics. \n \nThe task force observed the following trends from its interviews with investors:  \n \n Investors rely heavily on extra-financial ratings to inform their ESG integration \nstrategy because:  \n \n− extra-financial ratings are helping to drive progress in companies’ CSR practices: as \nagencies adapt their methods and criteria, companies gain a clearer picture of those \nESG issues that are rising to the top of the agenda in a changing world,  \n− extra-financial rating agencies cast the net much wider than companies in terms of the \ninformation they collect (including geographical coverage). \n \n The inherent challenges of extra-financial rating make reporting a headache for \ncompanies (as issuers) and investors (as users) because:  \n \n− quality takes precedence over performance (if a company fails to report on something, \nit is rated zero for that aspect, with no regard for whether the issue is material for the \ncompany, for its ESG performance, or for its size); \n− risk management and policy-driven indicators take precedence over a company’s \nproducts and services; \n− the reliability of the data that agencies collect and assess is questionable, as more of \nthe heavy lifting is left to artificial intelligence, and as neither issuers nor agencies \ncomment on, or quantitatively analyse, the data; \n\n-173- \n \n− the data that agencies gather is not comparable over time, accentuating the need for \nforward-looking information (which involves costly R&D effort); \n− agencies have different aims and priorities: some (such as MSCI ESG Research) \nfocus on financial materiality, while others (like Oekom) are more interested in \nimpact; \n− agencies are opaque about the methods they use and how they weight their criteria (a \ncomplaint voiced equally by issuers), and it is hard to track the data they produce \nback to its source (because of how it is structured, and because agencies use artificial \nintelligence to produce it). \n \nThe extra-financial rating market: pressing challenges that underscore the need for \nbetter-structured information \nExtra-financial rating agencies are under strain on several fronts:  \n \n The digital revolution is disrupting the market. \n \nAll extra-financial rating agencies, without fail, are harnessing artificial intelligence and \nother new technologies to automate data collection and aggregation, and to tailor the \ninformation they provide to investors’ particular visions, investment strategies and risk \nappetites. This trend will only accentuate in the coming years.  \n \nAgencies (and, for that matter, investors) are increasingly developing deeper, more \nspecialised and more idiosyncratic ESG risk and performance analysis models as they \nlook to capture weak signals, weight risk factors, interpret indicators, and structure \nmateriality assessments (factoring in both how companies affect society and the \nenvironment, and how society expects them to conduct their business). The agencies and \ninvestors that the task force interviewed also expressed concern, without exception, that \nthe growing role of artificial intelligence and raw data from industry giants such as \nBloomberg was jeopardising human involvement in the rating process. \n \n Extra-financial rating agencies must rethink how they are paid, and their business \nmodel more generally.  \n \nThe current business model, whereby investors and asset managers are agencies’ only \nsource of revenue, is untenable – even for those agencies that have been taken over by \nU.S. credit rating agencies and proxy advisory firms. Going forward, it seems likely that \nextra-financial rating will become just one line of business for much larger outfits such as \ntraditional credit rating agencies.  \n \n The value that agencies add is under question. \n \nCan agencies branch out beyond their stock information sources (corporate disclosures) \nand rating role and widen the net to include information from other sources such as the \nmedia, NGOs and the courts? Increasingly, agencies are positioning themselves as \n“facilitators”, helping users navigate the complex minefield of extra-financial information. \nYet the viability of that business model is uncertain, as investors change the way they use \nextra-financial information and as more and more of them develop proprietary models. \n\n-174- \n \n Agencies need to address concerns around conflicts of interest. \n \nInvestors are agencies’ primary source of revenue – an arrangement that provides a \nguarantee of independence. What is less obvious, however, is how agencies maintain a \nclear divide between rating services and other aspects of their business (such as index \nprovision and proxy advisory services).  \n \n Sovereignty of information is a delicate issue.  \nAs the extra-financial rating industry consolidates and U.S. firms gain a prominent \nfoothold in the market, due care and consideration must be given to how agencies can \ncontinue to source data from a wide variety of sources, and issue unbiased ratings. The \ntask force believes that extra-financial information should be collected and processed in a \nway that is sensitive to local economic and social priorities – in every region of the world, \nand the European Union in particular. \n \n \n\n-175- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAPTER 4 \n \n20 PROPOSALS FOR SECURING RELEVANT AND \nRELIABLE EXTRA-FINANCIAL INFORMATION: TIME \nFOR A COHERENT STANDARDISATION \n \n \n \n \n\n-176- \n \n20 proposals for securing relevant and reliable extra-financial information  \nAt the end of the inventory presented in the three previous chapters, the task force makes \ntwenty proposals which are presented in detail in sections 4.1 to 4.5 below. The structure \nadopted to present these proposals is based on the suggested ambition, both necessary and \npossible, to consider principles of action as well as a rigorous method to move forward. It \nthen focuses on the four pillars that articulate a complete system that is equal to the ambition \nand describes the organizational and planning principles essential for the success of such a \nproject. \n \n \n \n\n-177- \n \nIn the spirit of the task force, these twenty proposals constitute a set that makes it possible to \nconsolidate the first achievements and, above all, to amplify an already strong dynamic by \nintroducing legitimacy and coherence. Extra-financial \"data\" is key, for companies and all \nstakeholders alike: it is essential to give it a status comparable to that of financial \"data\" and \nto guarantee its relevance and quality. The time for standardization has come. In this field, \nEurope and its companies can \"race to the top\", develop an identity that promotes economic \nand social development and become an attractive center for responsible finance. \n \nThese twenty proposals can be summarized as follows: \n \n \n \n \n\n-178- \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-179- \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-180- \n \n4.1 The current situation of non-financial information fully implies and \njustifies the expression of a real ambition for progress in this area \n \nA pressing concern  \nFirstly, the task force notes that there is an increasingly pressing requirement for \ncomprehensive and consistent corporate information: \n The limitations of financial information are now broadly identified and recognised, and \nmost observers agree that progress on this reporting aspect is admittedly necessary, but \ninsufficient to reflect each company’s complex situation and interactions. \n \n There is therefore a widely-expressed need to better understand the situation in order to \ntake appropriate action, and this is reflected in the appeal for greater accountability from \ncompanies via comprehensive or integrated information on their businesses, combining \nboth financial and extra-financial data to provide consistency. \n \n Companies themselves are the most affected as this issue involves them directly, and they \nexpressed the need for broad-based consistency and a clear framework for both their \ncontribution and their obligations: \n \n− A large number of companies have now broadly taken on board the need for overall \naccountability on their performances, risks, opportunities and governance in both the \nway they manage their operations and how they communicate.  \n− There is of course a degree of reticence to let developments go ahead unmanaged, \nparticularly for reasons of confidentiality, excess regulatory burden, costs and \ncompetitiveness, but according to those involved, these issues are not insurmountable. \nDespite certain nuances noted by the task force and the inevitable questions on the \npace of change, this trend is now well-established, and many companies are actually \nkeen to take a proactive role in building on this progress. Beyond the mere marketing \neffects of more transparent communications, a fundamental trend is taking hold, and \nan issue that may initially have been viewed as a limitation is now in fact a driver for \nprogress. \n− Against this backdrop, companies have identified a necessary twofold transition, \nimpacting both management and communications: (i) moving from retrospective \naccountability towards forward-looking accountability, and (ii) moving from \naccountability on the impact on the company’s performances towards accountability \non the company’s overall effects on its so-called ecosystem. \n \n Company stakeholders all voiced very high expectations: \n \n− Investors all highlighted the need to conduct their policies using comprehensive \ndata – covering both financial and extra-financial aspects – to achieve an overall \nview of companies’ past and future performances. Some adopt this approach due \nto fresh regulation, but most investors apply this strategy for more fundamental \nreasons, as it allows for better decision-making and enables them to better meet \ntheir saver clients’ expectations, both professional and retail. \n\n-181- \n \n− Other company stakeholders – whether staff, clients, suppliers or vendors – also \nresolutely expressed their interest in comprehensive information. Companies lie at \nthe heart of the value creation process, after profits are distributed among the \nvarious contributors who provide resources. These value creation mechanisms are \nfelt to be more efficient and more responsible when comprehensive information is \navailable, promoting a spirit of cooperation rather than conflict. \n− Civil society is also a stakeholder, although interaction with the company is more \nindirect. The company is a key contributor to the social fabric and looking beyond \nmere financial transactions, the way it interacts with its broader environment can \nmake a major contribution to the broader ecosystem’s running, both in terms of the \nrisks incurred and the benefits derived. This leads to increasing communication \nbetween the company and civil society, establishing the need for companies to \nprovide – and for civil society to receive – relevant information. \n− Lastly, public authorities must be able to provide more substance for their \neconomic development policies, and this requires taking on board the value \ncreation mechanisms within companies in order to make decisions on these aspects \nas part of their mandate within the broader institutional set-up. These authorities \nensure that each stakeholder is granted the appropriate rights and also complies \nwith its obligations, which are the foundations for a society based on the rule of \nlaw. \n \n More broadly speaking, there is a feeling of urgency among several participants, in \nparticular on the causes and effects of climate change. However, beyond this vital \nissue, all stakeholders are driven by the realisation that certain key environmental \nresources are finite. Companies are not solely responsible for this aspect, but they do \nhave a pivotal role to play in economic development and value creation, so they are \none of the main forums for making progress on these vital challenges. \n \nA set of conceptual and technical resources available, with room for improvement \nExtra-financial information has moved well beyond academic theory, innovation and \nexperimentation for quite some time already, and the task force’s second point is that some \nconclusions can now be drawn from the progress made so far from both a conceptual and \ntechnical standpoint, in light of mature and complementary extra-financial information \nresources and scope for future progress in this area, in order to take development a step \nfurther: \n Looking to the conceptual framework, standards frameworks and indicators, there is a \nvery active community of highly dedicated stakeholders. The number of participants \ninvolved in this community and the quality of work are developing quickly, and while this \ngroup may sometimes express interest in different areas, particularly as a result of \ndifferent cultural contexts, it acts as a real potential source of action. The greatest \nchallenge in this respect is probably reconciling moves to set more formal practices to \nbetter serve investors with efforts to meet public interest requirements. \n \n Provisions that cover the actual content of extra-financial information have developed \nfrom a wide range of initiatives in an independent and sometimes contradictory way. Only \nrecently has there been an awareness that these various viewpoints need to be brought \ntogether to foster cooperation and integration, although initiatives witnessed so far have \n\n-182- \n \nrun into technical hindrances or issues of influence. However, the task force believes that \nthe stage are now set for consolidation of these aspects: \n \n− There are more complementary features than differences, which points to the \npossibility of operational platforms that can take advantage of the benefits provided by \neach of the various parties involved; \n− Differences on the overall information quality guidelines seem to be limited; \n− A clear decision can probably be made on the issue of materiality; \n− If we move beyond discussions on semantics and underlying ideology, scope for \ncompromise can probably be found by acknowledging several degrees of requirements \non extra-financial information within any given structure, and these depend on:  \n different types of stakeholders receiving the information i.e. investors’ \nexpectations as compared with all stakeholders’ expectations; \n differing degrees of complexity i.e. limited number of indicators vs. \ncomprehensive range of indicators sought; \n varying degrees of comparability i.e. quantitative and standardised vs. quantitative \nand specific to the company vs. qualitative/narrative. \n− In the context of such convergence, it is up to public authorities to make the necessary \nchoices, choosing the parameters that correspond to their objectives within the scope \nof possibilities opened by technical bodies, even if it means defining optional systems \nand/or different levels of requirements for different sizes of companies or different \nsectors. \n \n Provisions on the way extra-financial information is organised are still general or generic, \nas they attempt to cover all corporate communications situations. The task force believes \nthat this progress can also be used beneficially: \n \n− These provisions are primarily behavioural and methodological, and can be likened to \nthe quality guidelines outlined above \n− They can usefully be considered in developing standards as long as they comply with \nthe relevant legal framework when they are actually put into practice \n− Issues of reporting format are very largely based on national practices, so the relevant \npublic authorities – both national and European – are responsible for developing and \nadapting them \n \nMajor difficulties in operational implementation \nThirdly and lastly, the task force notes that current practical implementation difficulties \nact as a real hindrance to progress and absolutely must be resolved during the summary \nreport phase. The real challenge of extra-financial data must now be addressed: \n It was initially feasible to allow for considerable flexibility in implementing extra-\nfinancial information as a phase of transition was required. However, this period now \nseems to be over and this initial flexibility now appears to be a source of confusion rather \nthan a springboard for future progress, so a new stage is required. \n \n Once the principle of reporting extra-financial information is established, the main \nchallenges are the need for a minimal level playing field, and the importance of ensuring \nboth data comparability and quality. \n\n-183- \n \n Companies highlighted the severe difficulties they experience in implementing their own \nstrategy in this field and in meeting expectations in an intelligible fashion. Companies that \nhave made the most progress – and which have often allocated substantial resources to \nthis issue – are concerned that the easy option will win out. Meanwhile companies that \nhave not made the same headway would welcome tried-and-tested simple solutions. These \nconcerns were often voiced to the task force, and all companies also mentioned the risk of \nundue costs and an excessive regulatory burden, which they feel could potentially be \ndiscouraging. \n \n Meanwhile, fund managers and direct investors – who are on the receiving end of data \nproduction – have considerable difficulties in conducting their business correctly and \nmeeting fresh regulatory requirements and client expectations. During discussions with \nthe task force, they expressed their efforts to conduct their analyses as best they can, both \ndirectly and/or with the support of ratings agencies and data or index providers. However, \nthey all noted that they expect significant progress in both data quality and comparability. \nThey feel that the current situation is not sustainable and there is a risk that a data \noligopoly can develop and hinder their efforts to comply with their duties in an \nindependent manner. The most proactive participants expressed their interest in raw data \nfrom the company itself, which had not been processed or passed via an intermediary, in \norder to round out the existing indices, summaries and ratings on hand. They feel that they \nshould be responsible for forming their own opinions and that the quality of their \ndecision-making hinges on this point. \n \n The other stakeholders and representatives of civil society voiced similar frustrations to \nthose outlined by investors, although often to a much greater degree. Investors have a \nclear insight into companies as a result of their training, role and experience, as well as \nconverging general interests, but this is not the case for other stakeholders: \nmisapprehensions should therefore be tackled to ensure that the true fundamental issues \ncan be addressed. Once again, data will be key: the debate should not be about the \nexistence or reliability of data, but rather how it is interpreted and the ensuing overall \nconclusions. \n \n Lastly, the public authorities that the task force met with noted that stakeholders were at a \ncrossroads in terms of operating restrictions: it is feasible to set goals and principles, but it \nis now also vital to put forward practical solutions, and find the ways and resources \nrequired to make true progress, otherwise the development of this new key aspect of \ncorporate communications could be compromised. Expectations can vary in this respect, \nbut they are high overall across the European Union. However, views on the pace of \nprogress ahead are more varied at this stage. \n \nThe task force believes that an initial summary report to provide an update and take \naction is required in light of the combination of genuine expectations, sufficient technical \npreparation and real operating difficulties.  \nThe term “initial summary report” is used as extra-financial information is set to continue \nchanging in the foreseeable future. We are not yet seeing a stabilisation similar to the situation \nfor financial information, partly as certain gaps need to be filled and the set-up needs to be \nconsiderably developed, and partly as the issues addressed are not financial, and so they are \nconstantly changing due to environmental, social and technological developments and this \nwill continue to be the case in the future. Furthermore, all issues are not covered, and it would \n\n-184- \n \nbe advisable for fresh aspects to round out corporate information over time to support and \nstructure its contribution to economic and social development. \n \nAn ambitious approach \nWhen a goal is set, the way to achieve it will become clear, and the task force believes that \ntaking a practical approach – with several levels, proportionality, and several phases – does \nnot preclude an ambitious goal. There are differing viewpoints in this respect, and it is \nimportant not to set a goal without first considering the approach to be taken and the resources \nrequired. Many believe that taking a range of practical short-term actions is the right way to \nstart targeting a distant and therefore uncertain goal.  \nHowever, experience shows that reconciling these two timeframes, the concrete short-term \nand the sustainable long-term, is a powerful source of action in both the public and private \narenas, and the challenges raised by extra-financial communication can be suitably addressed \nby this type of approach. The task force therefore recommends focusing on the “path”, while \nalso clearly voicing the “destination”, particularly as there are very real expectations and a \nreal challenge on the ability to reach this goal, as well as the relevant timeframe. It is \nimportant to take a practical, concrete and stringent approach across all the various stages in \norder to meet these expectations, while also constantly focusing on the goal that many feel to \nbe necessary. \nThe task force believes that this ambitious approach and the overarching aims could be \nsummed up in simple terms as follows: \n In terms of actions: mobilise companies on the transition towards an inclusive and \nsustainable economy and financial system. \n \n In terms of transparency: provide comprehensive and reliable information for investors \nand other stakeholders on companies’ contribution to sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment. \n \nThe focus on both of these objectives could highlight the importance of: \n Promoting an initiative to encourage companies to make the transition to a sustainable \neconomy by targeting the SDGs as the ultimate goal;  \n The need for reporting to be as extensive as possible, based on a body of sustainable and \ntransparent indicators right along the value chain, that do their utmost to provide a \nforward-looking view on all environmental, social and governance aspects;  \n A balance between extra-financial reporting target audiences (investors and other \nstakeholders), as a prerequisite for standardisation. \n \n \n \n\n-185- \n \nPROPOSALS \n \nIn conclusion to this section, and focusing on the objective of transparency, the task \nforce suggests the following objective: \nProposal 1: Provide all corporate stakeholders with high-quality extra-financial \ninformation to assess their contribution to sustainable economic, financial and social \ndevelopment. \n \n \n \n\n-186- \n \n4.2 To meet the objective, mix approaches have to be put in place: \nstandardisation convergence, added value summary, digitisation \npublic legitimacy and proportionality and exemplarity \nIn order to achieve the proposed ambitious objective, fostering a necessary consensus \nand making progress overtime, this task force suggests five methodological steps:  \n Focus on encouraging all potential areas for consensus at each relevant level by taking a \ngradual convergence approach; \n \n Develop a realistic and gradual action plan for each level that can be implemented over \ntime by taking a critical path approach;  \n \n Adopt a technological pragmatism approach to reconcile project management with IT \ndevelopments, while ensuring the following point; \n \n Achieve public legitimacy for the principles and standards used in preparing extra-\nfinancial reporting; \n \n Set a degree of requirement for each level, taking on board risks and contributions by \nadopting a proportionality approach; \n \nThe mobilization of all relevant levels in a \"gradual convergence\" approach \nIn order to progress, the task force proposes to mobilise all levels of decisions: accordingly, \nfocal points can be developed on the basis of aspects that can garner consensus by taking \na “gradual convergence” approach.  \nThe task force is aware that deciding the relevant levels of action is probably one of the most \ndifficult tasks at hand, as the convictions voiced by the various participants and their \ndetermination to act can vary significantly overall at this stage. In light of this diverse range of \nopinions, the task force feels that it is advisable to put forward proposals across all levels, \nwith the aim of developing action-oriented coalitions: \n An overall worldwide initiative would be warranted ideally, in light of the important \nchallenges at hand and the pressing nature of many of them, primarily climate change. \nThe task force thinks that the stage is not set for a comprehensive initiative at this stage, \nalthough it is vital to continue working towards this goal.  \n \n A comprehensive initiative is admittedly difficult to develop, but the task force suggests \nthat certain aspects be suggested to a broad-based consensus. This gradual step-by-step \napproach encourages a further step towards agreement at this level. For example, this \ncould involve: \n− Quality principles that extra-financial information must comply with; \n− General principles of classification of extra-financial information;  \n− A common basis of indicators, notably on climate-related indicators.  \n \nThese points are broached in detail below. They may appear to lack ambition, but agreement \non these issues would mark a major milestone. \n\n-187- \n \n The task force believes that the European Union is a key forum for potential consensus on \nextra-financial information:  \n \n− The majority of European citizens are highly aware of these issues; \n− European Union institutional bodies regularly voice their expectations in this arena \nand their determination to make progress; \n− Action plans are already under way on extra-financial information; \n− Current non-financial information provisions are or should be assessed as to their \neffectiveness; \n− Against this backdrop, the next European executive could and should take initiatives \nto address citizens’ concerns and meet requests from the Union’s other bodies, in \nparticular the European Parliament. \n \n A European initiative is therefore both timely and relevant. The task force also thinks that \nthe summary stage outlined in Section 4.1 could be conducted at European level and \nwithin the broader European Union framework. It would clearly be important to select the \nappropriate legal instrument when the time comes, i.e. directive or delegated regulation. \n \n A strong degree of harmonisation is obviously strongly advisable, but this type of \ninitiative may involve compromises, including options being offered to Member States, \nand it will be important to be watchful on this issue: \n \n− It is important to remember that the excessive number of options prompted companies \nto abandon the Accounting Directive as the operating standard for financial \ninformation for listed companies, as they adopted IFRS instead; \n− The task force deems that it would not be politically suitable, or technically possible or \nopportune, to repeat this situation for extra-financial information; \n− The task force recommends restricting the use of options as much as possible; \n− If options are made available to Member States, the task force suggests that they be \nintegrated into bundles or that Member States form groups to select the same options \nto restrict disparities and present straightforward and easily understandable outlines. \n \n The task force believes that there is also a determination to make progress beyond the \nEuropean Union, and this could be used as a springboard to promote cooperation to take \nthe matter forward: \n \n− This cooperative approach should enable participants to discuss and co-develop \ncertain aspects, or even agree and work towards more broad-based initiatives. This \ntype of cooperation is inherently flexible.  \n− The task force believes that a cooperative approach should be explored and adopted. \nDiscussions conducted by the task force with the various bodies were not sufficiently \nextensive due to the time allocated, but they were adequate to conclude that this is a \npromising possibility.  \n− This could involve organised cooperation with countries that seek to meet some or \nall of the EU’s goals. In this respect and merely by way of example, the task force \nnotes that the United Kingdom could provide a potential area for cooperation in this \nrespect, depending on the final Brexit scenario. Progress already made together on \nthese issues and overlap on areas for focus should be leveraged, as these aspects can \nprove useful if we concentrate on shared goals rather than differences. Other countries \nare very aware of the challenges raised by extra-financial information and it is \n\n-188- \n \nimportant to remember that the European Union is often seen as a useful partner on \nthese issues: there are high expectations for its actions and its initiatives are closely \nobserved. \n− This could also involve cooperation organised with private sector bodies, i.e. all \nbodies that act to promote extra-financial standards. They make a vital contribution \nthat can be used as the building blocks to take this process further and more swiftly. \n− In any case, the task force recommends taking a clear and transparent approach by \nsetting out these various areas for cooperation in a simple and formal way via \nagreements that set goals (discussions, co-development), resources and the intended \ntimeframe. \n \n Lastly, the task force thinks that national initiatives within European Union Member \nStates can be used to round out the European-wide approach mentioned above, setting \naside any potential transposition of this legislation into national law. There are some \nmajor areas of national legislation on corporate information that could be made more \neffective and align more closely with targeted progress on extra-financial information. \nThis does not mean trying to outdo any areas of legislation, but rather modernising and \nmaking it effective, comprehensible and straightforward. Examples of this are provided at \na later point in the report. These areas of legislation are obviously dependent on national \ncontexts, so this requires a list and action plan for each Member State. \n \nA critical path through step by step summaries in order to consolidate the decisions \nIn light of the situation in this area, the task force believes that the development of extra-\nfinancial information remains a long-term goal that requires a critical path over time, \nalong with strict management, while not compromising an ambitious view of the target to be \nreached: \n Even if we apply the lessons learnt from accounting and financial standard-setting to step \nup the pace and if we assume that there will be relatively major efforts from the \ncommunity that currently promotes the development of extra-financial information, this is \nstill a vast initiative and it faces substantial political and technical challenges that will take \ntime to address. The time required reflects the difficulty and the importance of the \nchallenges at hand, so the task force believes that it is realistic to take a 5-7 year \ntimeframe, or even perhaps as much as 10 years if aligned with the SDGs, in light of the \nurgency of the various aspects. This is still highly ambitious as compared with the current \nsituation. \n \n However, this goal does not rule out a first short-term milestone at end-2021/ \nbeginning 2022 for example. The task force considers that the circumstances lend \nthemselves to a rapid synthesis of what has been achieved, this synthesis itself introducing \na strong added value from the outset: it is both integrating and catalytic. Such a step has a \nstrong symbolic character. \n \n This implies a division into phases that could be structured according to the usual \norganisation of project management of this nature, making it possible to reconcile \nconcrete progress in the short term with a long-term strategy;  \n \n Meanwhile, if this initiative is developed within the broader European Union framework, \nit will be important to work on overall convergence, based on cooperative approaches \n\n-189- \n \nand/or broad-based initiatives following on from changes in focus or if certain key issues \nbecome more pressing. \n \n Managing this type of project requires a stringent approach, and even if the community \nmentioned above is involved, and a cooperative approach is taken, appropriate resources \nwill be needed. The legal aspect is also essential in many ways, but it is insufficient: it is \nboth the culmination of in-depth work (particularly on standards) and a starting point for \nimplementation by companies. The quality of work upstream and downstream is therefore \nas decisive as the legal aspect itself. \n \nTechnological pragmatism \nAccounting and financial standardisation is currently running up against the emergence of \nnew information technologies, and it is useful to draw a number of conclusions from this \nsituation.  \nExtra-financial information can already use new information management technologies: \n New information technologies provide a great number of fresh opportunities, and the risks \nand scope of these possibilities are broadly unexplored, particularly as regards the \nfollowing: \n \n− Information arrives in real time, so times for analysis, action and communication \nincreasingly overlap; \n− There are growing numbers of information sources and companies are no longer \nnecessarily the main source of information on their own businesses. There are now \nseveral sources from outside the company, and the volume of this type of information \nis increasing along with its influence; \n− The digitalisation of information can lead to a more simplistic view, although artificial \nintelligence is improving to help manage this complexity; \n− Information storage and processing capabilities can be deemed to be unlimited in \npractical terms, and this increases information management capabilities in the \ncompany and also on the company; \n− It has become difficult to assess the reliability of information. Faithful representation \nand materiality of information are subject to caution, and it is difficult to separate \nobjective raw data from interpreted and subjective data. Data approved by governance \nbodies and/or checked by independent third parties is difficult to distinguish from \nunverified information. \n \n Against this backdrop, the standard-setting process must avoid a number of pitfalls: \n \n− The first could be referred to as “excessive standardisation”. It is ironic to observe that \nthere can be long discussions on technical aspects of complex standards, while at the \nsame time, technological resources can be used to organise data in a certain way and \nmuch more quickly, or provide several different takes on the same situation, \ndepending on the various different viewpoints; \n \n− The second potential pitfall is when the standardisation process focuses exclusively on \ncontent, without setting any reporting structures, or at least outlining a basic format. \nThe task force believes that it is vital to set out a reporting structure i.e. nomenclature \n\n-190- \n \nor taxonomy, format for financial statements. IFRS and US GAAP were faced with the \nissue of digitalisation, with XBRL, and this has proven to be a difficult experience \nboth then and now, particularly in terms of governance aspects for converting hard \ncopies of information into digital information, while also ensuring the reliability of \nthis information and its verification. \n− The third point is the issue of excessive data simplification, which allows for fast and \nsimple digitalisation of information, but also makes for an overly simplistic view. \n \nThese various issues lead to risks on both data quality and comparability. \n The task force notes that data storage and processing capabilities mentioned above seem \nto put an end to the debate on the conciseness of corporate data. The volume of \ninformation provided is not a truly relevant issue as long as: (i) information can be \nanalysed at several levels, (ii) information is outlined using a clear nomenclature (table of \ncontents and cross-reference table) that supports both analysis by physical users as well as \ndigital analysis, (iii) links are well organised, and (iv) the type and reliability of each piece \nof information are provided. \n \n The task force feels that the difficulties outlined are not impossible to overcome if the \ntechnological aspects are introduced as early as possible in the standard-setting process on \nthe various difficult issues outlined in the paragraph above. \n \nLegal value for extra-financial principals and reporting standards \nThe task force considers that the necessary standardisation of non-financial information \nshould benefit from the legitimacy conferred by its development and its adoption in the \npublic sphere. \nAccording to the task force, future non-financial reporting standards shall have a legal level \nequivalent to that recognized in accounting and financial standards. This is the condition for \nthe recognition of non-financial information as a fully-fledged dimension of the company's \nglobal information. This is not at odds with a non-financial reporting perimeter that combines \nobligations, standardised options and non-standard voluntary developments in a well \nmeasured way: if a good mix of obligations, incentives and practices is needed, a robust \nimplementation of it must be based on a foundation of quality standards, recognised and \nlegally enshrined. \nThe legal recognition of standards is a condition for the legitimacy of the overall system. In a \ngiven institutional system, it establishes an alignment between the technical methods essential \nfor progress, developed as close as possible to operational reality, and the stakes of the \ngeneral interest, as determined by the constitutionally responsible authorities. \nFor all the reasons mentioned in this report, the task force believes that the development and \nadoption of non-financial reporting standards should be organized today in the public sphere.  \nThe task force feels that legal value for the relevant guidelines is a major step in \ndeveloping extra-financial information in an orderly way. This stage is now both \nnecessary and possible: \n\n-191- \n \n Currently available standards are private in nature. They can refer to guidelines issued by \npublic authorities, but bar certain exceptions, these references do not have any legal \nconsequences, especially as these guidelines are not requirements. \n \n The task force believes that this situation is no longer compatible with the broadly-\naccepted view of the rule of law after the initial experimental/transition period. The \nsystem introduced by the Accounting Directive in the European Union is relatively brief, \nwhile further details are appropriately provided by guidelines, which cannot in themselves \nreplace a set of standards. It is broadly considered that transposition of the directive led to \na fairly wide range of regulation, and practical implementation is still deemed to be very \ndiverse and uneven.  \n \n It is important to make clear room for practical aspects, but many would like applicable \nrules to be clarified. There is still an excessive degree of confusion shrouding the efforts \nmade by various parties and the stakes are too high for companies, stakeholders and civil \nsociety as a whole for this confusion to be allowed to last. \n \n It now seems to be an appropriate time to consider a fresh legal stage: standards must be \nadopted in line with democratic practices that apply to this type of issue. The task \nforce believes that extra-financial information must be afforded a similar degree of \nlegitimacy to financial information. The major economies cannot delegate this legitimacy \nas extra-financial information closely hinges on very pervasive economic, social and \nsocietal aspects, even more so than financial information. Clear progress can be made on \nalignment and even convergence by taking the cooperative approach outlined above. \n \n As already stated, sufficient technical preparation has been made to now consider \nembarking on Phase 1 including adoption of standards.  \n \n Standards must not be confused with their scope of application, which can include \nobligations and options. The task force therefore notes that it believes that adopting \nstandards does not necessarily solely involve obligations. However, it is worth \nremembering that standards are applicable for both the mandatory and optional aspects. \n \n The task force feels that legal recognition for standards frameworks should be conducted \nat EU level. \n \nProportionality, Optionality and exemplarity \nThe task force highlights that the extent of requirements on extra-financial information \nmust be decided on the basis of risks that the company faces and creates, as well as its \ncontribution to economic and social development. The principle of proportionality is well \nknown and does not require extensive comments from the task force, but it is worth noting \nthat this is an important principle for action and providing some reminders in terms of \nthresholds, optionality and materiality: \n A proportionality-based approach – built on size thresholds – is appropriate and has \nalready been tried and tested, but the task force puts forward three recommendations: \n \n\n-192- \n \n− Consider reducing thresholds within reason, as some countries have already done, by \nembarking on a new stage and announcing it well ahead of time. The aim would be to \ncover a significant percentage of economic activity, otherwise efforts will not be \nconsistent with the goals targeted. \n− Check that threshold calculation methods are consistent, clear and suitable. The task \nforce feels that harmonisation in this area is vital. \n− Use business taxonomy efforts to include high-risk activities in the obligation scope, \nregardless of the size of the companies involved. The task force considers that high-\nrisk sectors should be covered systematically. \n \n The flipside of proportionality is optionality: it is important to encourage companies that \nare not subject to extra-financial reporting obligations to provide this information on a \nvoluntary basis. The task force is convinced that companies – even smaller businesses – \nshould take this virtuous approach, setting an example that could encourage others. It \nwould also be useful to offer simplified optional set-ups to avoid hampering companies \nwith an excessive regulatory burden. \n \n The issue of proportionality also overlaps with the question of materiality:180 \n \n− The task force deems that proportionality means only requiring a company to \ncommunicate on issues that are significant for its own specific situation \n− However, it feels that this approach should also involve two additional aspects: \n \nOn the one hand, the company should explain its decisions on materiality; \n \nOn the other hand, it is preferable that decisions taken be approved by external \ncontrol.  \n \n \n                                                           \n180 This is discussed at a later point in the report. \n\n-193- \n \nPROPOSALS \n \nTo conclude this section, the task force makes the following proposals: \nProposal 2: Act at all relevant levels (global, European Union, national). \nProposal 3: Integrate initial achievements and create added value by carrying out \nsuccessive syntheses. \nProposal 4: Introduce digitalisation right from the start. \nProposal 5: Achieve public legitimacy for the principles and standards used in preparing \nextra-financial reporting. \nProposal 6: Provide impetus for the process by combining proportionality, voluntary \naction and exemplarity. \n \n \n\n-194- \n \n4.3  Relevance and quality of non-financial reporting is based on four \npillars: \nprinciples, \ncontent, \npresentation \nand \ngovernance \n(accountability, control and supervision) \nBased on the key principles selected to conduct the summary report stage, the task force \nproposes to set the relevance and the reliability of the extra-financial information based \non four pillars:  \n The first pillar defining the general framework; \n  \n The second pillar proposing content for Sustainability standards; \n \n The third pillar proposing presentation standards (Sustainability reporting standards); \n \n The fourth pillar defining the responsibility framework (Accountability principles).  \n \nPillar 1: the general framework: general quality principles of the extra-financial \ninformation  \nThe task force feels that it is possible to garner consensus on the quality guidelines that \nshould apply to all financial information: \n They are all broadly based on the guidelines generally applied for accounting and \nfinancing information (IASB, FASB, Accounting Directive in particular) and their \nextension, mutatis mutandis, to extra-financial reporting appears both possible and \nadvisable; \n \n There may be terminological differences, but the task force believes that they can be \naddressed. The set of generally recognised quality guidelines, which are sometimes \nclassified into the most used groups, is based on the following six aspects, whether for \nindividual pieces of information or for the entire organised body of overall information: \n \n− Faithful representation, sometimes also referred to as reliability: information must \naccurately reflect the reality it describes. This aspect can be likened to the principle of \nneutrality, which is sometimes used: information must not be distorted, but rather it \nmust enable the reader to draw his/her own conclusions. It can also be equated with \nthe principle of completeness when it refers to an organised set of information: faithful \nrepresentation can only be achieved when information is complete; \n \n− Relevance: information must be adequate in terms of both quality and scope so that \nthe reader can make an informed decision. Information must be meaningful on all \naspects required for both understanding and decision-making, and in this respect, this \nprinciple can be likened to the issue of materiality, which is applied to the content of \nthe information (not the selection of information). It is also similar to the principle of \ndecision usefulness, which is sometimes used. Relevance should not only be static, it \nshould be assessed dynamically and present information about future activities and \nperformance (forward looking), even if this is more difficult; \n \n\n-195- \n \n− Understandability: information must be understandable for any reader with \nreasonable knowledge; it must be expressed and presented in a clear way, with no bias \nor ambiguity; this is similar to the principle of clarity that is sometimes used; \n \n− Comparability: information must allow for comparison of the company from one \nreporting period to another i.e. over time: it must also allow for peer-to-peer \nbenchmarking i.e. compared with the same type of information from other companies. \nThis is similar to the idea of consistency, which is sometimes used to mean \ncomparability over time; \n \n− Verifiability: information must be able to be compared to supporting evidence; \n \n− Timeliness: information must be prepared and made available swiftly i.e. within the \ntimeframe required for recipients’ decision-making. \n \n Looking beyond these six aspects, there are also some specific aspects of extra-\nfinancial information that should be mentioned here: \n \n− Inclusiveness: this is the issue of relevance for whom; it means deciding who are \nthe recipients or users of the information on the company: are they investors only \nor also all stakeholders? Discussions on this issue have changed as financial \ninformation is now considered to be primarily intended – although not exclusively \n– for investors, who are known as primary users, while also useful for other \nstakeholders.  \n \nHowever, this shift is not enough to address all stakeholders’ information \nrequirements. The task force notes that a great deal of information is useful for all \nrecipients, but some information may be primarily intended for non-investor \nstakeholders. In this case, the task force recommends mentioning under the \nrequired “relevance” guideline that this means relevance for both investors and \nother stakeholders: those in charge of implementing quality guidelines should then \nadd to information aimed at both user categories by providing information deemed \nuseful primarily for the second category. The choice should of course be made \nclear via classification and/or nomenclature. \n \n− Connectivity: in some respects, extra-financial reporting is still emerging, and it \nadds to financial reporting practices where the practices for drafting and reporting \ninformation are already well established. The task force feels that corporate \ninformation is a comprehensive whole and that it is vital to develop and present \nextra-financial information in very close connection with financial information, in \nkeeping with the concepts of connectivity, integrated thinking and integrated \nreporting promoted by the IIRC. \n \n Overall, there are seven quality guidelines – six along with the issue of connectivity – \nthat may be summarised as follows: “extra-financial information must provide faithful \nrepresentation, and be relevant (for investors and other stakeholders), understandable, \ncomparable, verifiable, timely and connected to financial information.” \n \n\n-196- \n \n The task force notes that these aspects may seem obvious or lack ambition, but they \nactually involve relatively demanding requirements. The task force believes that these \nquality guidelines could be put forward for implementation worldwide, and this would \nprovide a strong qualitative foundation, of a public nature, for developing extra-\nfinancial information.  \n \nPillar 1: the general framework - a classification of the information  \nThe task force feels that it is important to put an end to the frequent confusion on the type \nof extra-financial information by applying a clear classification of this information \nbased on its characteristics: \n Unlike financial information, which relies on solely monetary information, extra-financial \ninformation has very varied characteristics, which have different meanings. The recipients \nof this type of information are often confused as to the characteristics of the information \nthey receive, and different types of information are mixed up together. This confusion also \nmakes it difficult to digitalise information correctly, and makes information difficult to \nverify, as those in charge of this process must adapt the type of opinion they issue to the \ntype of the information they verify. \n \n The task force believes that there should be an initial degree of clarification and assurance \nfor extra-financial information. This could involve reasoned classification, which would \nmake it easier to standardise content, establish nomenclatures, and facilitate the work of \npreparers as well as verification, analysis, processing, digitalisation and assessment of \nvolumes for each category.  \n \n By way of example, classification could be based on the following distinctions: \n \n− An initial distinction should be made between qualitative information (narrative- N)  \nand quantitative information (quantitative –Q); \n− Further distinctions could be made in the narrative information category as follows: \n \nDistinctions in terms of subject i.e. governance-G, strategy-S, policies-P, \nmethodology-M, \n \nA distinction based on the time period covered is probably not required; \n− Further distinctions in the quantitative information category could be made as follows: \n \nDistinction on the unit of measurement: monetary-Mo, non-monetary-nMo, \n \nDistinction based on type of information: position at a given date, resources used, \ntarget (Position-P, resources-R, Targets-T). \n \n This process would lead to a set of ten standardised categories:  \n− NG, NS, NP, NM \n− QMoP, QMoR, QMoT \n− QnMoP, QnMoR, QnMoT181 \n \n This classification should probably also state which pieces of information are primarily \nintended for other stakeholders to help users analyse and process information documents. \n                                                           \n181 N/narrative, G/governance, S/strategy, P/policy, M/methodology \nQ/quantitative, Mo/monetary, nMo/non-monetary, P/position, R/resources, T/target \n\n-197- \n \nThis involves information where the financial impact cannot necessarily be projected on a \npredictable timeframe, but that is deemed to be vital by some or all non-investor \nstakeholders and can therefore be included in frameworks i.e. applying the inclusiveness \ncriterion outlined above. The issue of this type of detail is somewhat complex and the task \nforce considers that further analysis should be conducted during the summary phase, \nparticularly as regards feasibility. \n \n This classification, applied to each aspect of information, could also allow for \nqualification of information during the external control process and therefore provide a \nlevel of assurance.182 \n \n This classification may appear to be just a detail, or perhaps too precise or not precise \nenough. However, once it is finalised, this set-up would act as a powerful resource to \nsupport extra-financial information and the task force thinks that it could be put forward \nas a proposal for application worldwide. Such classification offers the necessary \nframework to an extra-financial information taxonomy. \n \nPillar 2: content standardisation – definition of a general framework \nThe task force believes that it is key to draft and adopt an initial harmonised set of \nstandards for general extra-financial information.  \n Each company faces a general range of challenges – and extra-financial information is \ndesigned to clarify these aspects – so the task force firmly believes that a general broad-\nbased approach is therefore required. A purely sector-based approach may be useful, but it \nis insufficient (see details below on complementary sector-specific guidelines). \n \n A general set of standards should be comprehensive: \n \n− It should cover all the relevant information categories i.e. traditional ESG aspects \n(environment, social, governance) and intangible categories where possible; \n− The task force is aware that ESG categories have now achieved a much greater degree \nof maturity than intangible categories. It believes that it is also important to make \nprogress on developing intangible categories with the aim of promoting faithful \nrepresentation. The actual principle of providing information on these categories, as \nwell as the inclusion of sections in frameworks and related nomenclatures are a major \nstep, even if detailed content initially – and perhaps inherently – lacks standardisation \nand is broadly left to each sector or company to define; \n− The set of standards should cover all indicators deemed relevant for each category, \nbased on the classification put forward. \n \n Readers should not be put off by the idea of a comprehensive framework as long as this \nextensive aspect includes on the one hand application of the principle of materiality and \non the other hand, a carefully considered scope of mandatory information. A framework \nmust be designed like a library where there are mandatory aspects or “must haves”, \nrecommended aspects or “good to have” and possible aspects, or “interesting to consider”. \nWithin the range of standardised information, it seems useful to establish a common core \n                                                           \n182 A/audited , R/reviewed  \n\n-198- \n \nas outlined below, to establish the degree of usefulness and hence the potential mandatory \naspect for each piece of information. \n \n The task force believes that the target framework should be a combination of existing \nframeworks, particularly the GRI (the SASB framework is addressed from a sector \nstandpoint below). This summary combination would involve the following approach, \nbased on due process: \n \n− Critical review of existing frameworks: \n \nClassify information based on characteristics, as outlined above \n \nAssess relevance and analyse based on usefulness \n \nPotentially eliminate information not deemed useful where appropriate \n \nEnhance standards on potentially mandatory information \n− Identification of any potential shortcomings: \n \nAdd categories where necessary \n \nIdentify and draft additional standards \n− Develop summary \n− Consultation \n− Implementation. \n \n On the basis of the aspects outlined above, the task force is clearly not in favour of mass \nimplementation of any particular standard framework without the technical assessment \noutlined above and without the legal process and policy options discussed below. The task \nforce considers that the summary work should be conducted in conjunction with private \nstandard-setting bodies based on the terms outlined above. \n \nPillar 2: content standardisation – complementary sector-specific guidelines  \nThe task force believes that it is appropriate to draft and adopt sector-specific guidelines: \n The task force thinks that the sector aspect of extra-financial information is key to \nensuring that it is relevant. One of the most vital aspects for information is comparability, \nyet this is difficult to ensure and there is widespread acknowledgement that there are three \nstages of comparability: \n \n− Comparability of a company’s performances between one time period and another, \nwhich ensures quality of the performance assessment system \n− Peer-to-peer comparability within the same sector, to conduct best-in-class \ncomparisons and choices \n− Comparability across all sectors, to conduct broad-based best-in-universe comparisons \nand choices \n \nPeer-to-peer benchmarking within the same sector is vital and provides an extensive range \nof information, so the SASB’s approach is laudable in this respect. However, as often \nmentioned, other stages are required, so the SASB’s work must be included as a \ncontribution within a broader overall summary approach. \n \n\n-199- \n \n The task force’s suggestions on developing and adopting sector-specific standards \nalongside general standards are, mutatis mutandis, the same as those expressed for general \nstandards, although some additional aspects should be mentioned: \n \n− A careful analysis must be conducted of professional or general frameworks that could \nbe used, in order to avoid an excessive geographical slant by providing a more \ncomprehensive view. \n− The same applies to information and indicators required to characterise any given \nsector. \n− Setting aside considerations on general information or the common core, the sector \nview must not be overly simplistic, and it must take on board both narrative and \nforward-looking aspects, i.e. targets and scenarios. \n \nPillar 3: standardisation of presentation – definition of a taxonomy \nThe task force believes that comprehensive corporate information can be better organised \nas part of a broader international standardisation effort. \nIn light of the extensive and diverse range of regulation and practices, the task force purposely \nfocuses here on principles, while also putting forward practical proposals. \nThe overall structure of information provided by companies is too complex: \n It is important to distinguish the following for companies, as they constantly issue a range \nof information:  \n \n− Summary information that is published on a regular basis to comply with regulatory \nrequirements, after approval by the highest governance bodies within the company; \n− All other information that is published by companies on a daily basis: \n \nTo various recipients \n \nIn several circumstances  \n \nOn several issues  \n \nBy managers with varying degrees of responsibility  \n \nVia several channels. \n  \nSummary information must comply with very stringent quality requirements, but rules for \ndrafting and publishing other information vary from one company to another in terms of \nprocedures and internal control. \n \n We can list three categories for information that must comply with very stringent quality \nrequirements and is generally subject to regulatory conditions: \n \n− Financial statements \n− Mandatory information outside financial statements: mandatory information can \ninvolve either general themes or sections (where content most often does not have to \ncomply with a specific structure), specific themes (where content does not have to \ncomply with a specific structure or content is relatively limited and defined), or \nspecific information \n− Additional information provided at the company’s behest, which can take various \nforms, and hinges on each company’s communication policy \n\n-200- \n \n \n The last two categories of information are published in the management report or in \nseparate reports, and are often combined within one or several broad-based documents i.e. \nannual report, registration document, integrated report, etc. They can have various \ndifferent designations, which makes the situation unclear. \n \n The connection between the financial statements and the management report is generally \ndeemed to be vital, but it is not easy to establish the relationship between very \nstandardised information (accounting and financial information) and other much less \nstandardised information i.e. information in the management report. In light of this, there \nare many alternative performance measurements and sui generis indicators, although \nbodies such as the IASB endeavour to define some of them.  \n \n Successive series of regulation have led to a wide range of information building up, \nranging from the most general to the most detailed, as well as highly diverse structures \nfrom one country to another, depending on each area’s traditional approaches. It is \ntherefore particularly difficult to make comparative assessments for audiences who are not \nfamiliar with the history and practices in each country. It is challenging to achieve an \noverview of the overall structure for information, which leads to difficulties in both \nanalysis and processing. \n \n Extra-financial information has to fit into this already complex structure, making analysis \neven more difficult. However, there is a degree of agreement on certain decisive issues: \n \n− Extra-financial information cannot be an integral part of financial statements, due to \nthe fact that the different pieces of information in question are of different types and \nhave different status, so it is important to avoid the risk of compromising accounting \nand financial information, which provides a well-understood foundation that must be \nmaintained. The task force shares this view. \n− Extra-financial information should a priori be included in information that is provided \noutside the financial statements, either directly or via references made in this section.  \n− If extra-financial information is standardised and/or mandatory and/or verified, it \nshould be flagged as such.  \n− The task force feels that integration and identification are important, but this requires a \nminimum degree of “generally accepted” structure. \n \n Analysis of European regulation (outlined in Section 3.2 above) provides an initial \napproach on the standard content for management reports by way of example (with the \ndifferent related reports where appropriate). To take this approach a step further, it is \nimportant to: \n \n− Ensure the compatibility of information required for the management report, \nStatement on extra-financial performance, and corporate governance report, and \norganise it into one single document \n− Round out this consolidated view and provide greater detail by factoring in regulatory \nprogress and best practices based on the completeness approach \n \n The task force believes that this type of standard content can be enhanced by providing \nsections or information reflecting intangible aspects that are discussed throughout the \nreport: \n\n-201- \n \n \n− There has been less progress on considering these issues, as work has focused more on \nrisks than on positive progress or opportunities, but intangible aspects are an integral \npart of comprehensive corporate information. \n− Capital classifications that allow for an assessment of complex intangible aspects, \nsuch as those put forward by the IIRC for example, can act as a basis to enhance \ncontent and help organise it. \n− Some of these aspects are open-ended areas as defined by the task force below. This \nenables companies to present their view of the situation and their prospects as they see \nfit, by moving beyond sets of standards. These areas cannot be subject to \nstandardisation, at least initially, although it is important to remember that some \ncurrently mandatory or recommended information that is designed to be included in \nframeworks, is inherently ambivalent, depending on whether it is relative or absolute: \nit can express a risk, but can also reflect intangible’s topic progress. \n \nAgainst this backdrop, the task force thinks that three areas for action can be suggested, and \nthese could work together to ultimately provide an intelligible and modern reporting structure \nthat is suited to today’s digital world. \nThe first area for action is to develop and adopt a taxonomy (nomenclature) for extra-\nfinancial information: \n The very concept of a taxonomy is a longstanding one. It applies in several fields i.e. \nnatural sciences, chemistry, etc., and reflects a determination to implement a carefully \nthought-out classification. Taxonomies have proven to be highly effective. \n \n Two examples can be mentioned in the accounting field: \n \n− IFRS taxonomy: IFRS are principles-based rather than prescriptive in terms of \npresentation format. This leads to variations in formats, which are often based on \nprevious national systems developed via tried-and-tested practices. This makes \nnational and international comparison more difficult and increases the number of \nalternative performance measurements. This situation has been seen as problematic for \nthe sustainability of the set-up, with the IASB reacting over recent years and \ndeveloping a taxonomy that provides for classification and tags for accounting \ninformation, whether figures or narrative, to make it accessible via a simple system, \nwhich in this case is XBRL. On the basis of this, the ESMA has been developing a \ncentral data system for financial information for listed companies, starting off with the \nbalance sheet and P&L, with the appendix to be addressed at a later date. The FASB in \nthe US took a similar approach a few years ago. \n \n− The French General Chart of Accounts: the idea of developing and implementing a \nnomenclature and a mandatory financial statement format (plan comptable général, or \ngeneral chart of accounts) has existed in France for a long time. This aspect had even \ntaken a substantial role, even from a sector standpoint, to the detriment of the actual \ncontent to a certain extent. So to rebalance this situation, the Conseil national de la \ncomptabilité (CNC, French National Accounting Board), and later the Autorité des \nNormes Comptables (ANC, French Accounting Standards Authority) focused on the \ncontent, but somewhat overlooked classification aspects. A more balanced approach is \nnow being applied, and the ANC has embarked on an initiative to streamline and \n\n-202- \n \nmodernise nomenclature and formats in order to better address the requirements \ncreated by digitalisation. \n \nDocument publication, automated processing (scoring for example), and tax declarations \ncan all be developed on the basis of this single nomenclature, which makes for an efficient \nsystem. \n Certain extra-financial information issues can therefore be pre-empted by drawing on this \nexperience of accounting taxonomies, by developing frameworks with the related \nnomenclature right from the beginning: \n \n− This means breaking down and tagging each piece of standardised information into \nconsistent data portions; \n− The task force believes that the starting point could be the classification of extra-\nfinancial information (as put forward in Section 4.3 above) combined with standard \nmanagement report content if necessary (format described below); \n− Each piece of information just needs to be provided with a rational digital \nidentification, based on the major information categories. \n \n This type of taxonomy can provide consistency and clarity when an index is added to the \npresentation of each piece of standardised information, regardless of where it is located, \nparticularly when information is inserted into more broad-based documents. A cross-\nreference table can also be added (depending on the template selected) to list mandatory \ninformation and its location. This applies even if the idea of a standard format, outlined \nbelow, is not adopted or if it is postponed. \n \n The task force’s view is that this type of system would make for considerable \nsimplification, clarity and relevance. \n \nThe second area for action is the development of a standard reporting structure (format) \nfor organising company information using a common outline:  \n The task force thinks that a standard structure or format is a very positive approach, as this \nenables users to read more easily, whether actual physical reading by users or in particular \ndigital processing of information. \n \n A reporting format must not be restrictive to the extent that it hampers the meaning of the \ninformation. There is no reason not to have an open-ended format for the management \nreport, or have fields where content can be included in any way. Unlike the financial \nstatements, which include finite financial information that must be pinpointed at a given \nmoment in time, the management report format can be infinitely incremental, and the only \nlimitation is the reader’s ability to absorb the information and computers’ ability to \nprocess it. \n \n The aim here is not to define this kind of format, but rather take a technical approach, \nwhich can be based on regulatory content and best practices observed. The task force \nbelieves that this work can be conducted within the timeframes outlined for drafting the \nPhase 1 standards discussed above, alongside this process and in keeping with it. This is \nan appropriate place for extra-financial information. \n \n\n-203- \n \n The task force’s opinion is that there are two options as to the format: \n \n− Option 1: the standard format is left to the discretion of each company, trusting that \neach company will see this as a useful set-up and that users will also be in favour of \nthis approach; \n− Option 2: the standard format is mandatory, as it is open-ended and enables companies \nto incorporate both their specific features and local legal specific aspects. \n \n In keeping with the principle of proportionality, the standard format could of course also \ninclude simplified versions. \n \nFor each jurisdiction, the third area for action involves modernising the corporate \nreporting structure: \n Whether as part of the application of a standard format or on countries’ own initiative, \nnational reporting regulations should in any event be modernised in order to adapt to fresh \nrequirements, without leading to an excessive build-up of information, while also \nfacilitating digitalisation of information. \n \n As part of this standard format process, it is important to set out national information and \nclassify into the format’s relevant sections (including in the open-ended sections if \nnecessary) and qualify them based on the nomenclature for extra-financial information. \n \n In the absence of a standard format, it is important to conduct the same process on the \nbasis of a clear national structure with the same goals. \n \nThe case for a minimum base of non-financial information \nThe task force raised the question, without deciding it at this stage, of the promotion of a non-\nfinancial information base. The task force believes that there should be two different \napproaches in this respect: \n An advanced model for countries or economic areas – such as the European Union – that \nhave taken a political decision to adopt comprehensive information for their corporations; \n \n A core approach, which could be applied at a global level, along with quality guidelines or \nclassification. \n \nFor companies under the advanced model umbrella, and in particular for the European \nUnion, once the set of standards is developed and adopted, the task force suggests a common \ncore of mandatory information as part of this framework, while other information would \nremain optional and act as incremental levels for progress in an effort to promote \nproportionality: \n It is important to reconcile the quality guidelines for extra-financial information with \nsufficiently straightforward and gradual application to ensure that standards are not \ndissuasive. The task force thinks that the idea of a common core of mandatory information \nis appropriate as part of the summary stage. \n \n\n-204- \n \n An analysis of the content of the Statements on extra-financial performance, as transposed \nand applied, can act as a foundation to assess both the volume and type of extra-financial \ninformation reported. On the basis of this assessment, the task force puts forward two \npossibilities: \n \n− The first involves developing a single common core based on a summary of the \nhighest levels of standards; \n− The second involves offering two alternative common cores, with one equating to the \naverage observed during the assessment and the other equating to the highest levels of \nstandards, with additional information deemed important being added to comply with \nany recent changes e.g. application of work by the TCFD. \n \n Information would be classified using the classification outlined above, subject to the \nprinciple of materiality with appropriate explanations. \n \n This common core would act as level 1 of requirements in terms of content (potentially \n1A and 1B in the event of alternatives), and would be mandatory. \n \n Beyond this common core, the task force believes that a gradual progression could be \nset out with increasing degrees of requirement i.e. level 2, level 3, etc. It appears \nreasonable to provide for a restricted scale of requirements of 4 or 5 levels. Each level \nwould have standardised content in accordance with the framework. \n \n Companies would obviously be able to decide to restrict their disclosure to level 1, or \nhave the option to provide disclosure in accordance with a higher level of requirement. \nThey could manage this progress over time and adapt their extra-financial information \nstrategy to take on board the results observed and the resources required. \n \n We feel that this type of approach is “virtuous” in that it sets out a minimum mandatory \ncore and then provides a number of optional levels of more demanding requirements. \nExemplarity can play an important role, particularly due to the pressing nature of \nexpectations and momentum already witnessed in this area. \n \n The task force has looked at the option of offering a simplified model for companies not \nsubject to extra-financial disclosure requirements and thinks that this type of model – \nadopted as an optional measure – is advisable and could be similar to a simplified version \nof level 1 above, or the core consisting of the ten aspects outlined below. \n \nAs part of this common core approach, which could be coordinated at a global level, the task \nforce believes that a very small number of extra-financial information components could be \nproposed for disclosure by all companies that are not covered by a more demanding \nregulatory framework:  \n Following on from the task force’s various discussions, it outlines the following list of ten \naspects as an illustration (including classification): \n \n− ESG governance (NG)  \n− Identification and description of risks (and opportunities) related to ESG across the \nentire value chain (NP and NM) \n− Energy use and intensity (QnMoP) \n\n-205- \n \n− Water use and related intensity (QnMoP) \n− Impact on biodiversity (NP) \n− Greenhouse gas emissions (QnMoP) \n− Health and safety monitoring (NP) \n− Average number of training hours per employee (QnMoP)  \n− Ratio of starting wage to minimum wage and for each gender (QnMoP) \n− Disclosure systems set up in the company i.e. lobbying, anti-corruption, money \nlaundering, etc. (NP). \n \n Information sought is primarily simple narrative or quantitative information, and not very \nforward-looking. Beyond the usefulness of this information in terms of communication, it \nalso has an educational use for the company itself and acts as a resource for awareness and \na reminder, as well as providing a potential source of action. \n \nThe accountability framework: defining governance rules \n \nStrenghtening governance (Pillar 4) \nGovernance on extra-financial data can be simplified: \n As has just been mentioned, extra-financial information should be included in \ncomprehensive corporate information published after approval by each company’s highest \ngovernance bodies.  \n \n Some corporate governance codes have already added this type of provision, and these \narticles could be extended and enhanced to align with the best practices observed. \n \n The aim is for corporate governance bodies to take responsibility for extra-financial \ninformation: \n \n− It is therefore important to firstly agree that extra-financial information should be an \nintegral part of the management report in all its various potential components; \n− In governance terms, this inclusion differentiates extra-financial information from \naccounting and financial information, which is subject to specific provisions; \n− It is also important to ensure that the management report is subject to appropriate due \ndiligence from the corporate governance bodies from a regulatory standpoint; \n− From a practical point of view, three steps can be taken on extra-financial information: \n \nAppoint at least one member of the board who acts as the official point of contact \nand is in charge of questions on this area and this information, and is responsible \nfor reporting on the specific tasks to bodies responsible for approving the \ninformation, \n \nAdd updates on extra-financial information matters into the agenda for governance \nbody meetings on a set basis, and at least systematically when the management \nreport and accounts are being approved, \n \nMake express mention of discussions and decisions from governance bodies on \nthese issues in their meeting minutes. \n \nThese provisions should also be reconciled with those on the duty of vigilance, \nwhich is a positive measurement and useful practice when applied in a \n\n-206- \n \nproportionate way and where widespread application on an international basis is \npossible. \n \n It is worth mentioning that the task force believes that the issue of responsibility \nmentioned here is not intended to unduly increase executives’ legal responsibility: \n \n− A reference to fiduciary duty is already strong in itself; \n− There is already a duty of responsibility as regards the management report, which can \nbe stipulated if necessary; \n− Corporate governance codes can be amended to better address this aspect if necessary; \n− Name and shame processes are very useful if they are applied in a stringent, measured \nand impartial manner; \n− The terms of legal responsibility could of course be reviewed if any clearly \ninappropriate behaviour on extra-financial information is observed. \n \nThe generalisation of external control (Pillar 4)  \nBroader external control for extra-financial information should be considered and \nprocedures should be specified:  \n Feedback on the positive aspects of external control of the Statement of extra-financial \nperformance suggests that widespread application of this approach could be considered for \nextra-financial information as a whole and geographically. \n \n According to the opinions heard, costs involved are low enough for the task force to take a \npositive view of the cost-benefit ratio. \n \n The task force notes the following points as regards procedures: \n \n− External control is particularly effective when there are standards on content; \n− External control is also particularly effective when there is a taxonomy as well as \nreporting formats; \n− Broader application could be introduced at the same time as implementation of Phase \n1 standards; \n− From a technical standpoint, control standards can be outlined on the basis of work \nalready conducted: \n Assurance levels should be clarified, \n This clarification can be based on the data classification put forward and the \nensuing taxonomy, \n An additional simple codification would help qualify the degree of assurance for \neach piece of information, which would make it easier for users to understand the \ninformation and would also ensure the feasibility of automatic processing: \nreasonable assurance for data produced alongside accounting information and \nretrospective quantitative non-monetary data, and moderate assurance for the rest; \n The control report would be more simple as it could establish a direct connection \nwith information that has been controlled, outline the degree of assurance for each \ntype of information and where necessary draw observations with precise reference \nto the information in question. \n The status of participants and their supervision must be organised specifically and \nappropriately, taking on board the specific features of the area being audited. \n\n-207- \n \n \nActivating supervision (Pillar 4) \nSupervision of extra-financial information by the market authorities can be bolstered: \n The authorities met by the task force expressed their commitment to this aspect and their \nwillingness to take action. \n \n Market authorities are obviously at the end of the information production chain and the \neffectiveness of their supervisory role depends on the following aspects: \n \n− Existence of frameworks (guidelines on quality, content, format) \n− Legal value for frameworks \n− Clear outline of mandatory aspects, along with options and details on these \n− Applicable governance principles \n− Existence and quality of external control \n \n Against this backdrop, it looks feasible to bolster supervision for extra-financial \ninformation alongside the development of this information itself: \n \n− The relevant authorities could initially contribute to an in-depth assessment of \npractices, as they already do or plan to do. In this respect, they could assess the best \npractices and inaccuracies observed. They could also contribute to the standardisation \nprocess and set up test-type structures that would enable companies to conduct \ninitiatives that could be used as pilots or experiments. \n− After this initial stage, the relevant authorities’ role and duties on extra-financial \ninformation should be specified where necessary. \n− Secondly, the authorities would take on their full responsibilities resulting from the \nfirst stage. \n \n In this context, the market authorities would move from a supporting and incentive role to \na supervisory role, and also have the power to apply sanctions: these will need to be \nclearly outlined. \n \n \n\n-208- \n \nPROPOSALS \n \nTo conclude this section, the task force makes the following proposals: \n \n \n\n-209- \n \n4.4 A rigorous organization of non-financial standardisation in project \nmode is decisive \n \nOrganising standardisation of extra-financial information in the public sphere \nThe task force believes that the standardisation required for extra-financial information \nmust be afforded the necessary legitimacy by development and adoption in the public \nsphere.  \nThe task force believes that future standards on extra-financial information must be given an \nequal legal value to accounting and financial standards, to ensure that extra-financial \ninformation is viewed as an integral component of comprehensive corporate reporting. This is \nalso compatible with an extra-financial information scope that combines mandatory and \nstandardised optional aspects, as well as unstandardised voluntary developments, all brought \ntogether in a measured way. This range of obligations, incentives and practices is necessary, \nbut solid application of these aspects must be based on a set of high-quality, recognised and \nlegally valid standards. \nLegal recognition for standards is required to ensure that the entire system is afforded \nlegitimacy overall. In any given institutional set-up, this provides alignment between the vital \ntechnical aspects required for progress, drafted in close accordance with real operating \ncircumstances, and issues of public interest as decided by the constitutionally responsible \nauthorities. \nThe task force believes that extra-financial information standards should now be developed \nand adopted in the public sphere, in light of the various aspects outlined in this report. \nIn the task force’s opinion, this can only occur by taking a cooperative approach with the \nrelevant public stakeholders on these issues. The task force’s goal was not to conduct this type \nof concertation, but it did hear some useful opinions on this issue and was able to make an \ninitial analysis on some potential ways for organising this process, including the following \nseven: \n This approach should be taken in pilot mode, at least in the initial phase, regardless of the \nlegal structure adopted. This objective involves steering the project with regular updates \nand deadlines, along with a delivery date (Phase 1: end-2021). It is important to avoid \npremature institutionalisation in this task force-oriented approach. \n \n The initiative should be conducted independently. This has an impact on the status of \nthose in charge of technical aspects of the project and also has an effect on the way risks \nof potential interference with other priorities are managed, such as priorities resulting \nfrom accounting standardisation or supervision goals. \n \n The project implicitly requires a strong, organised and confident relationship with the \npublic authorities. While it goes without saying, the task force would like to reiterate the \nimportance of reconciling a task force’s operating capabilities with its accountability \ntowards public interest representatives, who must validate the way the initiative is \n\n-210- \n \norganised, regularly monitor progress and ultimately ensure that standards are translated \ninto the appropriate legal framework. \n \n The success of this initiative depends on the one hand on participants’ independence but \nalso on the contribution from all stakeholders on the other hand. This requires a \ncoalition, managed by the public authorities. It is important to take advantage of the \nexperience outlined in this report and the current momentum. The project’s operating \nstructure must factor in this aim and this existing commitment that acts as a driving force. \n \n The project must also be driven by a constructive cooperative approach: \n \n− Technical cooperation with private bodies that consistently act across all aspects of \nextra-financial information i.e. GRI, SASB, IIRC, involved NGOs, etc. can facilitate \nthe suggested summary stage: a great deal of work has been conducted and there is no \nneed to repeat work already achieved on these areas. The task force believes that a lot \ncan be gained by cooperating in this way on both substance and in terms of resources \nand time. Where relevant, this cooperative approach could include service agreements \nwith financial compensation; \n− International cooperation with public or parapublic counterparts, involving a political \nand technical cooperative approach, aimed at promoting cross-fertilisation, potential \nconvergence and more broad-based initiatives. \n \n The initiative requires a special task force. Experience of accounting standardisation \nshows that a high-quality, well-organised team is required to successfully conduct this \nprocess, particularly when working in pilot mode. It is difficult to get to the crux of the \nquestion when numbers are beneath a certain threshold, so this type of initiative needs a \nstable team of several tens of people throughout the duration of the project. The task force \nonly gives an approximate – and fairly broad – figure, and probably inappropriate to \nprovide more detail at this stage. However, the task force notes that this initiative requires \nsubstantial human resources and a large portion of the team could be made up of qualified \nstaff from companies and bodies that work in this area on temporary secondment to this \nproject, as long as their work conditions ensure their independence. \n \n In view of these various aspects, the project involves the use of financial resources. The \ntask force believes that an approximate figure can be provided by the resources mobilised \nby private bodies as analysed in Chapter 1 and that these resources are not unreasonable in \nlight of the fundamental challenges. These resources could be provided by the public \nauthorities, the corporate community and partly by stakeholders who wish to encourage \nthis progress by providing specific support. It is obviously advisable that the provision of \nfinancial or other resources does not compromise the task force’s independence. At this \nstage, it is clearly too early to look beyond the principles that have just been mentioned in \nthis respect.  \n \n \n\n-211- \n \nTimetable \nThe critical path as described above involves a breaking down into phases that could take \nplace as follows:  \n− Phase 1 (2019-2021/2022?): Consolidation phase including: \n Technical work required to stabilise standards based on technical consensus with \nall stakeholders, and based on political agreement: content standards and reporting \nstandards, \n Enhancement via public/private cooperation, \n Legal aspects, setting obligations and options, \n Vital educational and explanation efforts to support companies’ implementation, \n Investors and other stakeholders take standards on board. \n− Phase 2 (2022-2025?): Implementation of Phase 1 standards concurrent with \ncontinued efforts on Phase 2 standards, based on a similar approach to Phase 1. \nAssessment of Phase 1 and quality of implementation. \n− Phase 3 (2026-2029?): Implementation and assessment of Phase 2 standards. \n \nMeanwhile, if this initiative is developed within the broader European Union framework, it \nwill be important to work on overall convergence, based on cooperative approaches and/or \nbroad-based initiatives following on from changes in focus or if certain key issues become \nmore pressing. \nManaging this type of project requires a stringent approach, and even if the community \nmentioned above is involved, and a cooperative approach is taken, appropriate resources will \nbe needed. The legal aspect is also essential in many ways, but it is insufficient: it is both the \nculmination of in-depth work (particularly on standards) and a starting point for \nimplementation by companies. The quality of work upstream and downstream is therefore as \ndecisive as the legal aspect itself. \n \nPROPOSALS  \n \nTo conclude this section, the task force makes the following proposals: \nProposal 17: Entrust a standard-setter in the public sphere with drafting content and \nreporting standards in project mode \nProposal 18: Foster cooperation between public authorities \nProposal 19: Foster cooperation competent private bodies \nProposal 20: Establish an ambitious, three-phase critical path: 2019–2022 / 2022–2025 / \n2025–2029. \n \n \n\n-212- \n \n4.5 Favourable cost-benefit ratio for development of extra-financial \ninformation  \nIt is difficult to conduct an objective comparison strictly speaking of costs and benefits \nresulting from the swift development of extra-financial information, as this type of \ncomparison calls for many extra-financial parameters related to companies’ intangible aspects \nas well as the public interest. However, these extra-financial parameters often address \nexpected benefits and they therefore affect the denominator of the cost-benefit ratio more, and \nshould logically improve any strictly monetary ratio. \n \nBearing in mind this caveat, the task force came to believe that the feedback gained during \nthe process point to a positive view of the cost-benefit ratio for swift and orderly \ndevelopment of extra-financial information. While not claiming to outline an exhaustive \nlist, the task force notes the following: \n Taking extra-financial aspects on board in company management appears to ensure better \nperformances and therefore greater value creation on a comparative basis. While the \nrelationship of cause and effect is not proven, an integrated approach adds a competitive \nadvantage and all stakeholders are aware of this, first and foremost companies themselves. \n \n Current relative confusion on implementation in an environment that provides insufficient \nstandards and stability leads to several costs that are difficult to estimate as they are often \nhidden. Companies need clear rules and a level playing field to grow effectively and \nconfidently. \n \n Investors cannot gain a clear view, and this damages the markets’ smooth running and \nefficiency. Greenwashing has a potentially high cost. Investors are therefore prompted to \ninvest in systems that endeavour to support them in a context where data is not reliable. \n \n Data collection, storage and processing must start with raw and high-quality data to be \ntruly efficient, neutral and transparent. As quality becomes more relative, information \nmoves away from the source, thereby increasing the risk of bias and loss of meaning. It is \nimportant for companies to keep control of raw data. \n \n Data digitalisation is a strong source of relevance (availability and accessibility of \ninformation) and savings (cost of data) if it is conducted on a solid basis. Digitalisation \nrequires standardised content, nomenclatures and formats. \n \n In light of the savings related to digitalisation and the scope for productivity and \nefficiency it creates, standardisation conducted on the basis of the conditions suggested \nwould have a very limited cost. \n \n \n\n-213- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendixes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-214- \n \n \n \n \n\n-215- \n \nAppendix 1 – People interviewed for the purpose of this report  \n \n1.

The level of non-\nfinancial information provided is thus considered relatively low compared to France or Italy, \nfor example. At government level, the German authorities are at this stage in a more “wait-\nand-see attitude” towards non-financial reporting, taking into account ongoing European \ndevelopments.  \n \nState of transposition of the NRFD Directive in Germany: \n \n- \nScope: companies with more than 500 employees (listed companies, insurers, banks, \nexcept eligible SMEs), whose annual turnover exceeds 40 million euros (or) whose \nbalance sheet total exceeds 20 million euros. \n- \nFormat: annual management report or separate report (but mentioned in the management \nreport). Possibility of publishing on the company's website up to 4 months after the \nmention in the annual report (on this point, BASF, Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Börse \nAG stated that publication in a separate report was a \"step back\").  \n- \nScope of information required (little detail in the transposition, compared to the FR and \nItaly): environmental issues; social issues; corporate governance (societal); human rights \nand fraud and the fight against corruption.  \n- \nDefinition of materiality: impact on the company's performance and impact of the \ncompany's activity on its ecosystem.  \n- \nThe KPIs relevant to the company's business model must be published (no suggestion in \nthe regulations, unlike the FR).  \n- \nComply or explain\" model. \n- \nIn the event of non-compliance: the company, members of the Board of Directors and \nmembers of the Management Board are held liable.  \nIf the information provided is false, the director of the company may be fined (criminal \noffence), up to €10 million or 5% of the company's total annual turnover or double the \nprofits made as a result of the non-compliance (or losses due to non-compliance).  \n- \nVerification: responsibility of the financial auditor for the submission of the non-financial \ninformation statement only (no mandatory content verification or verification by an \nindependent body).  \n \nExisting regulations and recommendations \n \n \n \n1. German Accounting Standard No. 20 (GAS 20) on the management report group (the \nequivalent of the French management report) updated on 1 June 2018 following the \ntransposition of the CSR directive implementation Act \n \nA large part of the standard is dedicated to non-financial information (consolidated non-\nfinancial statement). This standard sets out a framework for at least the topics to be addressed: \ncompanies with more than 500 employees must publish at least information on \nenvironmental, wage, social, human rights, and anti-corruption and fraud issues.  \n\n-251- \n \nThe company must explain the policies followed on these various topics, the identification of \nrisks, the objectives it has set itself and the procedures put in place to obtain reliable \ninformation. The standard provides examples of possible indicators but does not impose any. \nThe company is completely free to define the indicators to be used and how they are to be \ncommunicated (order, presentation, etc.). The latter can use existing standards (national, \nEuropean or international) at183 its choice. The standard even provides for the use of parts of \ndifferent repositories as long as the chosen method is well explained but does not mention any \nof them. \n \n2. The Code for Sustainable Development (since 2011) \n \nAfter an extensive consultation period, Germany, through the German Council for \nSustainable Development (RNE), published a Code for Sustainable Development, the first \nversion of which was published on 13 October 2011. \nThe RNE was created in April 2001 by the Chancellery and is an advisory body to the federal \ngovernment on sustainable development184. He is also responsible for representing the \nGerman position in the various international and European bodies. At the national level, it \nprovides a structuring framework for the policies of each Lander. This committee is \ncomposed of 17 members, who have a 3-year mandate.  \nThe code is a voluntary standard that allows Organisations and companies to publish their \n\"sustainable\" performance based on 20 criteria185, including explaining their strategy and \nmanagement of the sustainable issue and communicating environmental and societal \nopportunities and risks (see Appendix).  \nCompanies that follow the Code issue a declaration of compliance and these declarations are \npublic and freely accessible. This code was updated with the transposition of the Directive in \n2017. Although no reference to a reference system is given in the body of the code, the \nchecklist proposed in 2017 proposes points of attention for each criterion, in a \"comply or \nexplain\" logic. These points refer to the GRI or EFFAS from time to time. This checklist is \nmore like an analysis grid. \nIn 2017, the NRE published a framework for addressing the MDGs and set 11 priority themes \nfor work from the MDGs. \n \n \n \n                                                           \n183 No Framework is explicitly mentioned in the GAS 20. \n184 It advises the government on its sustainable development policy and, by presenting proposals for targets and \nindicators, seeks to advance the Sustainability Strategy as well as propose projects for its realization. A further \ntask is to foster social dialogue on the issue of sustainability. The objective here is to increase the level of \nawareness among all concerned and the population as to what sustainable development actually means by \ndemonstrating the consequences of social action and discussing possible solutions. \n185 “The Sustainability Code: benchmarking sustainable business”, 2017 edition.   \n\n-252- \n \nPrivate initiatives  \n \n1. BVI recommendations on responsible investment \n \n186BVI is an association of German investment funds that aim to improve market stability and \nregulation. After publishing recommendations on the general principles of responsible \ninvestment, the BVI published rules of conduct in October 2016 which, in Part V, require \nfund managers to integrate environmental and social aspects into its governance analysis. \nThese principles are very general and require managers to establish appropriate criteria for \nanalysis in this area. \n \n2. H4SF: Hub For Sustainable Finance Germany \n \nCreated in 2017 by NRE and Deutsche Börse AG, this initiative aims to accelerate awareness \nof sustainable development for financial markets and to integrate ESG criteria into investment \npolicies. This led them to publish 10 recommendations for sustainable finance in Germany \nand to organize in October 2017 the first sustainable finance summit in Germany under the \naegis of the Ministry of Finance, joined by the Ministry of the Environment for the second \nedition in 2018. \n \nAvailable practices and statistics \nAt the end of 2018, 477 companies claimed to comply with the Sustainable Code187 and \npublished 821 declarations, a significant increase compared to 2017 due to the \nimplementation of the European Directive. The Code provides a structuring framework for \nanalysis also for companies outside the scope of the Directive. \nThe indicators used by German companies are 84% derived from the GRI benchmark, the \nremaining 16% using indicators from EFFAS (European Federation of Financial Analysts \nSocieties).  \nActions in progress  \nFor the NRE, the aim is to use the objectives of sustainable development by 2030, in order to \nalign its policy by devoting its resources mainly to raising awareness among all stakeholders \n(civil society, teachers, etc.), through training activities and seminars, and by multiplying \nmulti-stakeholder partnerships (G20 Partnership with Africa). According to interviews \nconducted by the task force, there are no plans to conduct further work on the issue of \nindicators. \n \n                                                           \n186 After Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008, public confidence in the financial market was seriously \nundermined. This loss of trust in the capital market and its stakeholders also hit the investment sector. As a \nresult, the German investment business has a strong interest in stabilizing the general environment for the capital \nmarkets. For this reason, BVI works constructively with legislators and regulators in order to achieve further \nimprovements in terms of regulation. This holds true all the more when you consider that German investment \nfunds neither caused the global financial crisis nor required state aid. Today, investment funds are already the \nmost transparent and most highly regulated financial products.  \n187 Data published by the NRE.  \n\n-253- \n \nUNITED KINGDOM \n \nExisting regulations and recommendations \n \n \n \n1. Legal texts: the strategic report188 \n \nThe strategic report (first applied in 2006) is the central element of the regulatory framework \non the publication and content of financial and non-financial reports. It has been updated to \ntake into account the elements of the transposition of the European non-financial information \ndirective in 2018.  \nThe non-financial information required is linked to environmental and employee information. \nFor listed companies, we find the three pillars of CSR, respect for human rights and the fight \nagainst corruption and fraud with an analysis of risks (and not opportunities). The strategic \nreport is not prescriptive on the framework and indicators to be used, but requires that the key \nindicators used be defined and explained.189 \n \n2. Recommendations issued by the FRC (Financial Reporting Council)190 \n \n Practical guide on the strategic report \nIn July 2018, the FRC published specific recommendations on the preparation of the strategic \nreport on the basis of best practices. The main objective is to get each preparer to \"tell his \nstory\" on the basis of general principles with the ultimate goal of meeting the shareholder's \nneeds and having an easy and coherent reading relationship between the different types of \ninformation. \nThe recommendations recommend an approach for determining key indicators according to \nmateriality, specific to each company (no checklist) and indicate the general principles to be \nfollowed: the report must be fair, balanced, understandable, clear, concise but complete with a \nprospective vision if necessary. \nThey also provide examples of context, questions to ask, but no prescription on indicators to \nuse (none of the commonly used reference frameworks are mentioned). \n \n UK Corporate Governance Code \nIt is a code of conduct for better governance with a general objective of preserving value in \nthe long term (including sustainability objectives). The first version of the Code dates from \n1992 and applies to listed companies. This code also remains exclusively on principles of \nbehaviour. \n \n Works of the FRC-Lab \nLast September, the FRC Lab launched a working group on the191 reporting analysis of \nclimatic and social elements. The objective is to identify the different practices, the content of \n                                                           \n188 Part 15, Chapter 4A of the Companies Act 2006 \n189 414CB (2)(e) \n190 The FRC's mission is to promote transparency and integrity in business. The FRC sets the UK Corporate \nGovernance and Stewardship Codes and UK standards for accounting and actuarial work; monitors and takes \naction to promote the quality of corporate reporting; and operates independent enforcement arrangements for \naccountants and actuaries. As the Competent Authority for audit in the UK the FRC sets auditing and ethical \nstandards and monitors and enforces audit quality. \n\n-254- \n \nthe reports, to identify best practices and the way in which the information is used by \ninvestors. The report is expected by the end of 2019. \nIn parallel, on 30 October 2018, the FRC launched another working group, the \"The future of \nCoporate reporting\", whose conclusions (scheduled for late 2019) could lead to proposals to \namend the current regulations. The objective of this working group is to analyse current \npractices in terms of financial and non-financial reporting and covers all communication \nmedia (annual reports and others).  \n \nPrivate initiatives  \n \n1. The London Stock Exchange \nIn response to the growing demand for CSR information from the market and the possible \nimpacts on corporate operations, the London Stock Exchange published a guide in January \n2018 entitled \"Your guide to ESG reporting\". This educational guide explains the different \nissues and themes, how to identify them, the standards, the different existing reporting \nformats, the importance of green finance and responsible investments. According to this \nguide, the six essential standards are: the CDP, CDSB, GRI, Integrated reporting, SASB and \nthe United Nations Global Compact192. Nevertheless, the guide focuses attention on the \nMDGs and TCFD recommendations that currently seem to be taking over.  \n \n2. A variety of think-tanks \nAccounting For Sustainability (A4S),193 created under the aegis of the Prince of Wales in \n2004, initiated discussions to ensure that financiers take the shift to sustainable development \nand start thinking about the risks and opportunities associated with environmental and social \nissues. A4S has also been involved in the creation of IICBA and participates in many \ninternational initiatives such as the Natural Capital Coalition and the Commonwealth Climate \n& Law Initiative. \n \n3. The accounting profession \nThe accounting profession also made an early commitment to sustainability with professional \nbodies such as ACCA or ICAEW and has produced many guides and tools for the profession \nto support companies in their ESG reporting efforts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                     \n191 https://www.frc.org.uk/news/september-2018/call-for-participants-in-new-lab-project-climate \n192 See page 24 of the guide: https://www.lseg.com/esg \n193 https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/initiatives \n\n-255- \n \nAppendix 6 - The link between the TCFD's recommendations and the non-financial \ndirective  \n \nSeveral differences in structure, objectives and requirements exist between the TCFD and the \nEuropean Directive on non-financial information, which are particularly interesting to note in \nthe context of the revision of the Directive's guidelines in the light of, in particular, the \nTCFD's recommendations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: European Commission (TEG on Sustainable Finance), \"Report on climate-related \ndisclosures\", January 2019 \nAlso, we note that:  \n The non-financial Directive has adopted a risk-based approach.  \n \n On the other hand, the TCFD reference framework emphasizes both the risks and \nopportunities associated with climate change.  \n \n The Directive is addressed exclusively to companies.  \n \n The provisions of the Directive are based on the concept of the company's business \nmodel, namely \"the way in which it creates value and preserves it in the long term \nthrough its products or services\" (§4.1 of the Guidelines) on the basis of which the \ncompany's environmental, social and governance issues must be identified.  \n \n\n-256- \n \n On the other hand, the reference framework proposed by the TCFD is directly \nfocused on the specific issue of climate change.  \n \n On the other hand, the analytical framework proposed by the TCFD is also \nintended to guide investors in their investment choices.  \n \nIn the February 2019 consultation document on the revision of the guidelines, the TEG and \nthe European Commission conducted a comparative analysis to highlight the extent to which \neach of the TCFD's recommendations could complement the guidelines of the directive:  \n \nSource: European Commission, Consultation Paper on the Revision of Non-Binding \nGuidelines on Non-Financial Information, February 2019 \n \n \n\n-257- \n \nAppendix 7 - Summary of TCFD's Progress Report (September 2018)  \n \nOn September 26, 2018, TCFD published its 2018 progress report on the implementation of \nthe recommendations, published in June 2017.  \n \n[It should be noted that according to the exchanges between the task force and specialists and \nmembers of the TCFD, the conclusions and recommendations of the 2019 progress report - to \nbe published in early June 2019 - will not differ substantially from those detailed below: the \nreport will likely note progress in implementation, but also, in view of the climate emergency, \nthe need for acceleration (i) in terms of transparency by companies across all sectors of the \neconomy; and (ii) in terms of the use of scenarios to inform the resilience of corporate \nstrategy]. \n \nFor the record, the TCFD's recommendations specify the climate reporting elements within \nthe companies' reference documents for four pillars (governance; strategy; risk \nmanagement; indicators and metrics used), in a broader perspective than simply publishing \nthe company's carbon footprint, as described in the table below extracted from the progress \nreport:  \n \n \nThe TCFD's 2018 progress report notes that:  \n \n The vast majority of the companies surveyed (i.e. 1734 companies in 78 countries, \nincluding all G20 members) published information online with at least one of the 2017 \nrecommendations in their annual financial statements, annual reports or sustainable \ndevelopment reports;  \n \n Disclosure practices vary significantly from one sector to another (i.e. the energy \nsector being the best student) - the banking sector following the CFCT recommendations \nmainly from a risk management perspective.  \n\n-258- \n \n European companies remain the ones that most implement the recommendations.  \n \nIn its report, the Task Force highlights the progress necessary to achieve full, uniform, \ncomparable and useful disclosure for market participants:  \n \n Although companies publish climate information (i.e. costs of projects carried out; \ninvestments with climate implications; measures of environmental impact), few publish \nthe financial consequences of climate change on their business. However, investors are \nasking for quantitative information on the potential and actual financial impacts of \nclimate change on companies;  \n \n The TCFD recommendation to publish information on the resilience of companies' \neffective strategy based on more climate scenarios (including a +2°C scenario) remains \nthe least followed of all the recommendations. In addition, the TCFD encourages \ncompanies to publish more quantitative and qualitative information on how the \ncompany's strategy intends to respond to the risks and opportunities caused by \nclimate change;  \n \n The information published is often disseminated in a variety of reports (financial \nstatements; annual reports; integrated reports; sustainability reports), mainly within \nsustainability reports. The TCFD thus invites companies to concentrate their disclosure \nwithin a given report or, where appropriate, to make simple cross-references between \nreports in order to provide investors with the most complete information possible; and \n \n The TCFD recommends that companies clarify more clearly in the reports the \nimportance of projects related to climate change and their relevance to the \ncompany's overall strategy (i.e. increasing the company's resilience to climate change; \nreducing operating costs, etc.).  \n \nIn particular, in its report, the Task Force examined the disclosure practices of 25 \nmanagement companies, based on publicly available reports (i.e. financial statements; \nsustainability reports). Its observations are as follows:  \n \n Most management companies have described the role of the board of directors in \noverseeing climate change risks and opportunities, and the majority of them have focused \non describing the role of top management. Less than half of them described the roles of \nthe Board of Directors and management;  \n \n None of the management companies studied provided information on the risks and \nopportunities associated with climate change in the short, medium and long term - or on \nhow climate change was impacting their investment strategy;  \n \n Most management companies provide information on the identification and assessment of \nclimate-related risks, their management and the integration of these risks into their overall \nrisk management; and \n \n Few management companies provide information on the GHG emissions associated with \ntheir investments. \n \n\n-259- \n \nAppendix 8 - Scope of greenhouse gas emissions and propagation of climate impacts to \nthe financial and non-financial sectors \nA greenhouse gas emissions balance sheet - the need to define the sources of emissions that \nwill be taken into account in the balance sheet. This \"operational scope\" thus corresponds to \nthe categories and items of emissions related to the activities of the selected organisational \nscope (i.e. sites, installations and skills included in the balance sheet.).  \nThe main international standards and methods, first and foremost those resulting from the \n\"GHG Protocol\", define three categories of emissions194: \n Direct GHG emissions (or \"scope 1\") \nThese are direct emissions from fixed or mobile installations within the organisational \nperimeter, i.e. emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organisation; \n \n Indirect energy emissions (or \"scope 2\")  \nThese are the indirect emissions associated with the production of electricity, heat or \nsteam imported for the Organisation's activities; \n \n Other indirect emissions (or \"scope 3\")  \nThese are other emissions indirectly produced by the organisation's activities that are \nnot included in scope 2, but are nevertheless linked to the entire value chain (e.g. the \npurchase of raw materials, services or other products, employee travel, upstream and \ndownstream transport of goods, waste management generated by the organisation's \nactivities, the use and end of life of products and services sold, etc.).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Typology of greenhouse gas emissions - Internal presentation of Carbone 4 Finance \n \n \n                                                           \n194 www.bilans-ges.ademe.fr/fr/accueil/contenu/index/page/bilan%2Bges%2Borganisation/siGras/1  \n\n-260- \n \n \n \n \nChains of propagation of climate impacts to funded industries and financial activities  \n \n \nSource: Institute for Climate Economics (January 2019) \n \n\n-261- \n \nAppendix 9 - Overview of non-financial reporting outside the European Union:  \nUnited States; Canada; China and Japan \n \nUNITED STATES \nThe notion of \"Corporate social responsibility\" was born in the United States in 1953: the \ncompany is considered as a moral being that must ensure the well-being of its employees, \ntheir families and the community. Today, the American conception of CSR remains marked \nby the involvement of the company in the local community, philanthropy (i.e. the role of \ncorporate foundations) and patronage. In particular, the company will promote employee \nvolunteering with associations and their financial contribution to causes. \nThe role of the State, which is traditionally more liberal, is also less marked on CSR-related \nissues than in France, with less heavy but also more disparate regulations. However, there is a \ngreater focus on business ethics and governance issues, as illustrated by the Sarbanes Oxley \nAct (2002). \nRegulatory framework for non-financial reporting in the United States \n1. The S-K regulation on non-financial reporting \n \nIn line with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934, the SEC requires, within the S-K regulation (17 CFR Part 29195), a series of non-\nfinancial information to be provided by listed companies, in the annual report or in certain \nperiodic reports, including:  \n- \nThe description of the company's activity (item 101); \n \nIt should be noted that this item requires the publication of information relating to the \ncompany's compliance with US environmental regulations, namely concerning: (i) the \nmaterial effects of the company's compliance with local, state and federal environmental \nprovisions on the capital expenditures, revenues and competitive position of the company \nand its subsidiaries; and (ii) the substantial capital expenditures anticipated by the \ncompany for the development of environmental control infrastructure for at least year N \nand year N+1.  \n \n- \nThat of any pending legal proceedings (item 103), other than ordinary proceedings in the \ncourse of business, the amount of which exceeds 10% of total consolidated assets. \nRegarding environmental lawsuits, they must be published if the potential amounts of \nclaims exceed USD 100,000; \n \n- \nA description of the risk factors weighing on the company, without specific mention of \nESG risks (item 503 (c)); and  \n \n- \nThe Management Discussion and Analysis which aims to provide such other information \nthat the registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial condition, \nchanges in financial condition and results of operations. \n                                                           \n195 https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/part-229   \n\n-262- \n \n \nOn the latter, in 1987, the SEC had commented the utility of the Management and Discussion \nAnalysis report196: «The Commission has long recognized the need for a narrative \nexplanation of the financial statements, because numerical presentations and brief \naccompanying footnotes alone may be insufficient for an investor to judge the quality of \nearnings and the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. MD&A \nis intended to give the investor an opportunity to look at the company through the eyes of \nmanagement by providing both a short and long-term analysis of the business of the \ncompany».  \nReporting under Regulation S-K is considered mandatory by the SEC when there is a well-\nfounded uncertainty that may have a material effect on the financial statements of the \ncompany concerned, pursuant to an interpretation of the SEC of May 1989.  \n2. 2010 SEC Guidance regarding disclosure related to climate change \n \nIn February 2010, the SEC published an interpretation guide on reporting on the impacts of \nclimate change (and its physical effects) and legislative and regulatory developments relating \nto the fight against climate change on the activity and financial performance of listed \ncompanies197 - reporting being an integral part of the S-K reporting described above.  \n“For some companies, the regulatory, legislative and other developments noted above could \nhave a significant effect on operating and financial decisions, including those involving \ncapital expenditures to reduce emissions and, for companies subject to “cap and trade” laws, \nexpenses related to purchasing allowances where reduction targets cannot be met. \nCompanies that may not be directly affected by such developments could nonetheless be \nindirectly affected by changing prices for goods or services provided by companies that are \ndirectly affected and that seek to reflect some or all of their changes in costs of goods in the \nprices they charge”. \n \nThe SEC document notes that as early as 2007, petitions from institutional investors were sent \nto the SEC on the importance of specific climate change reporting. It also notes that, in \naddition to the reporting required by certain SEC (e. g. in the electricity sector) and \nEnvironmental Protection Agency sectoral rules, a variety of non-governmental organisations \nrequiring information (e. g. The Climate Registry) or repositories (GRI; CDP) allow listed \ncompanies to publish climate information.  \n \nIt is worth noting that, as early as the 1970s, the SEC published guidelines on how listed \ncompanies should take into account in their reporting the financial impact of compliance with \nenvironmental laws, based on the materiality of the information provided (No. 33-5170, 19 \nJuly 1971). In the 1970s and 1980s, the SEC worked to better articulate materiality \nrequirements for reporting under federal laws and regulations. In a 1976 decision (TSC \nIndustries v. Northway), the Supreme Court stated: \"the question of materiality, it is \nuniversally agreed, is an objective one, involving the significance of an omitted or \nmisrepresented fact to a reasonable investor[...]A fact is material \"if there is a substantial \nlikelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important\". \n                                                           \n196 Securities Act Release No. 6711 (April 17, 1987), Concept Release on Management's Discussion and \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, 52 FR 13715. \n197 https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2010/33-9106.pdf  \n\n-263- \n \n \nThe SEC also advises listed companies to publish information on: \n- \nThe impact of legislation and regulations, in particular related to the items constituting the \nabove-mentioned S-K regulation. The SEC insists that the company's assessment of its \nclimate reporting should not be limited to the negative consequences of regulatory and \nlegislative changes in environmental matters, but also to new opportunities presented by \nchanges in environmental law (e.g. carbon allowance trading system, etc.); \n \n- \nThe impact of international environmental treaties on corporate activity;  \n \n- \nThe indirect consequences of regulation or changing market practices, such as: lower \ndemand for high-emission goods; higher demand for low-emission goods; increased \ncompetition for technological innovation; higher demand for renewable energy; and lower \ndemand for services based on carbo-intensive energy sources. These elements can be \npublished in the Management Discussion and Analysis report. The document highlights \nthe reputational risk that can weigh on the company; and \n \n- \nThe physical impacts of climate change.  \n \n According to the task force's discussions with the SEC (Division of Corporate \nFinance), no evaluation of the implementation of the 2010 climate guidance by \nissuers has been conducted to date. It is also not intended to be revised in light of the \nTCFD's recommendations.  \n \nEvolution of non-financial reporting in the United States \n Status of reporting by US listed companies \n \nDespite the progress of American regulations on the subject (financial impacts related to \ncompliance with environmental rules since the 1970s; publication of guidelines since 2010; \ntypology of risks related to climate risk; investor awareness since the early 2000s), the \nabsence of a definition of sustainability in American law and the lack of political \nambition (absence of an ESG axis in financial regulation and American companies) have \nrelatively limited extra-financial reporting by American companies. In addition, it \nshould be noted that the American corporate culture, which is largely based on risk prevention \n(in order to avoid legal action), does not encourage significant appropriation of non-financial \nreporting.  \nThe KPMG (2017) report on social responsibility highlights the relative delay in the United \nStates on this point - both in terms of reporting on social responsibility (81% of societal \nreporting in annual reports; against 83% in France, 92% in India and 98% in India) and in \nraising awareness of climate risk (49%; against 60% in the United Kingdom and Germany \nand 90% in France).  \nThe above-mentioned KMPG report justifies the current state of reporting in the United States \nby: (i) increasing investor pressure; (ii) SEC S-K regulation (despite the low level of \nenforcement to date); and (iii) recent publication of industry benchmarks by SASB adapted to \nSEC regulatory requirements (which has substantially increased the rate at which companies \npublish ESG information in their annual reports).  \n\n-264- \n \nRecent calls for an evolution of ESG reporting in the United States \n \nIn 2016, the SEC publicly consulted financial actors on the advisability of revising its \nregulatory reporting framework (Concept Release on Business and Financial Disclosure \nRequired by Regulation S-K): this public consultation - which received more than 26,000 \nresponses - highlighted clear stakeholder support for strengthening ESG reporting.  \nOn October 1, 2018198, a petition signed by investors and professional investor \nassociations representing a total of more than $5 trillion in assets under management \nwas sent to the SEC to initiate a regulatory process on ESG reporting, arguing that \nvoluntary reporting is currently insufficient to meet investors' needs199. The petition highlights \nthe following arguments: \n(1) The SEC has clear statutory authority to require disclosure of ESG information, and doing \nso will promote market efficiency, protect the competitive position of American public \ncompanies and the U.S. capital markets, and enhance capital formation200; \n(2) ESG information is material to a broad range of investors today; \n(3) Companies struggle to provide investors with ESG information that is relevant, reliable, \nand decision-useful; \n(4) Companies’ voluntary ESG disclosure is episodic, incomplete, incomparable, and \ninconsistent, and ESG disclosure in required SEC filings is similarly inadequate; \n(5) Commission rulemaking will reduce the current burden on public companies and provide a \nlevel playing field for the many American companies engaging in voluntary ESG disclosure; \nand \n(6) Petitions and stakeholder engagement seeking different kinds of ESG information suggest, \nin aggregate, that it is time for the SEC to regulate in this area. \n \nOn the concept of materiality, the petition illustrates the financial materiality of ESG \ninformation for investors today, and increasingly so, and highlights the increasingly material \nnature of non-financial information201 (including, for example, cybersecurity - see the SEC's \n2011 guidelines on the publication of cybersecurity risks) for \"the reasonable investor\", taking \ninto account each company's own ecosystem.  \n On this point, the SEC also recalled that it was in line with the Statement on \nDisclosure of ESG matters by issuers published on 18 January 2019 by the \nInternational Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) - although it did not \nvote in favour of publishing the text within IOSCO.  \n \n«Jurisdictions’ securities laws generally require that issuers disclose material risks and any \nother material information in the context of their business and performance which is also \n                                                           \n198 https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2018/petn4-730.pdf  \n199 Investors with $68.4 trillion of capital are committed to incorporating ESG factors in their investing and \nvoting decisions as part of the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investing, that institutional investors \nwith over $95 trillion of invested capital support the Carbon Disclosure Project’s annual survey and that global \nassets under management utilizing ESG factors and similar screens were valued at $22.89 trillion at the start of \n2016 and constituted 26 percent of all professionally managed assets globally. \n200 “As Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Financial Stability Board, said with \nrespect to climate change, with “consistent, comparable, reliable, and clear disclosure” of firms’ forward-looking \nstrategies, both “markets and governments” can better manage the transition to a low-carbon future by \nsupporting the allocation of capital to its risk-adjusted highest-value use in that transition” (page 5).  \n201 Alan Beller, Foreword to SASB’s Inaugural Annual State of Disclosure Report, December 1, 2016, available \nat https://www.sasb.org/blog-alan-beller-pens-forward-inaugural-annual-state-disclosure-report      \n\n-265- \n \nin line with IOSCO’s Principle 16. As a general matter, in these jurisdictions, materiality \nis therefore the determining factor in considering whether information must be disclosed \nto investors in filings made under securities laws». \nFinally, the petition calls on the SEC to define clear ESG reporting requirements - in \nparticular on the standards used - for greater consistency, in order to reduce the \nreporting burden on companies and to achieve a level-playing field in this area.  \n«Today companies are burdened with meeting a range of investor expectations for \nsustainability information without clear standards about how to do so. A number of promising \nframeworks have been promulgated over the previous decade or decades, many of which have \nbeen mentioned in this petition: GRI, SASB, CDP, and now TCFD being the most prominent. \nAnd yet, because there isn’t clear guidance and an authoritative standard in the U. S. for all \npublic reporting companies to use, different companies are using different frameworks and \nmultiple mechanisms to disclose sustainability information. Thus, investors are still \ndissatisfied with the comparability of sustainability information, even between companies in \nthe same industry». \n Recent SEC pronouncements (2018-2019) \n \n In a speech202 given in September 2018, (Republican) Commissioner Hester M. Peirce \nhighlighted the difficulties of ESG reporting in terms of investors' fiduciary duties \nand a detailed understanding of environmental, social and governance issues:  \n \n«The difficulty in understanding the legal implications of using ESG to evaluate \ninvestments arises in part from the fact that the same investment may raise legal \nconcerns or may be entirely appropriate depending on the fiduciary’s intent.  For \nexample, investing in a company that develops green technology is likely appropriate if the \nfund manager makes the investment because of a belief that green technology’s popularity \nwill make it a profitable investment.  If, however, the manager makes the investment because \nof a belief that it is virtuous to support green technology regardless of its commercial \nprospects, it becomes less clear that the manager has fulfilled her fiduciary duty. \nThere are two problems with this conclusion.  First, given the breadth of topics that the \nterm \"ESG\" purports to address, it is difficult to say that, for any company, it is the \nESG factors in particular that have resulted in higher returns.  Second, because ESG \ncan mean so many things, a company may implement a number of policies that wind up \ncounted as \"ESG\" measures that are simply the same good practices that companies \nhave embraced for centuries.  The problem is that, because discrete, time-tested measures \nhave good results, once they are dubbed \"ESG,\" their success becomes an argument for \nimplementing all kinds of unrelated, untested measures that conveniently share the ESG label. \nThus we arrive at the next problem with using ESG factors: there are no clear \nstandards.  Even if we were to accept—and I do not—that it is desirable to use funds held by \nlarge investors as a means of fueling social change, it is not clear that the factors managers \nnow consider actually have the intended effects.  In many instances, ESG reporting has been \npresented as though it were comparable to financial reporting, but it is not. While \nfinancial reporting benefits from uniform standards developed over centuries, many ESG \nfactors rely on research that is far from settled.  Counting the number of female directors \n                                                           \n202 https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-peirce-092118  \n\n-266- \n \nmay tell you something about how well a company is run.  Or it may simply tell you that the \ncompany has more female directors.  There are studies going both ways. In most cases, the \ncompanies themselves are ill-equipped to make these determinations.  Does a company that \nbrews beer really have the expertise to assess what energy source would be the best for \nthe environment? \nSecond, there is a degree of subjectivity in the setting and application of standards. Some \nESG standards seem to reflect personal moral beliefs that may not be universally held.  Some \nfunds cite to ESG standards as a reason for no longer investing in companies involved in the \nfirearms industry. Again, it is perfectly appropriate for any individual to choose not to invest \nin any industry she finds objectionable, and funds currently exist for individuals who want to \nscreen out everything from guns to alcohol to gambling. But there is hardly uniform \nagreement among Americans on the subject of firearms, and many Americans see no harm in \nowning guns and gun stocks. Our capital markets should accommodate both groups. \nOnce a standard is set, deciding whether a company meets it can also be difficult. Is a \ncompany that operates on solar power up to snuff enough to satisfy environmental standards, \neven if it uses fossil fuel to power its own plant?». \n On 15 March 2019, the SEC's Director of Corporate Finance (Division of Corporate \nFinance), William Hinman, opened the door to possible additional SEC regulation on \nESG (wait-and-see) reporting, including better consideration of ESG risks by the boards \nof directors of listed companies, particularly on climate (highlighting the 2010 guidelines \nmentioned above)203:  \n«Sustainability disclosure continues to be of interest to investors and other market \nparticipants, and the very breadth of these issues illustrates the importance of a flexible \ndisclosure regime designed to elicit material, decision-useful information on a company-\nspecific basis. We understand that investors continue to engage with companies on \nsustainability topics and that market participants across the globe are giving significant \nthought to the types of sustainability disclosures the market is seeking as it strives to \nefficiently allocate capital. \n[…] \nSo it appears to me that the market is still evaluating what, if any, additional disclosure on \nthese topics would provide consistently material and useful information. The marketplace \nevolution of sustainability disclosures is ongoing – companies certainly provide more \nsustainability information than they did ten years ago – and allowing this evolution to \ncontinue should provide market participants with a continued opportunity to sort out the types \nof information they find useful. Had we leapt into action and issued prescriptive sustainability \ndisclosure requirements when people first began calling for them, I believe we would have \nstymied that evolution and stifled efforts to develop useful disclosure frameworks. \nSubstituting regulatory prescriptions for market-driven solutions, especially while those \nsolutions are evolving, in my view, is something we need to manage with utmost care. In \nthe meantime, we are watching carefully as market-led approaches develop in this area, and \nwe actively compare the information companies voluntarily provide – typically outside of \ntheir SEC filings – with the disclosure we see filed with us. \n                                                           \n203 https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/hinman-applying-principles-based-approach-disclosure-031519  \n\n-267- \n \nAs we approach this or other disclosure topics, I am always cognizant that imposing \nspecific bright-line requirements can increase the costs associated with being a public \ncompany and yet not deliver the relevant and material information that market \nparticipants are seeking. Adding requirements to the disclosure regime that do not \ndeliver benefits that justify their costs decreases the attractiveness of our public \nmarkets, which in turn can reduce the number of public investment options available to \nall investors. \nAs I’ve mentioned, an important objective of our disclosure framework is to allow investors \nto see the company through the eyes of management. I encourage companies to consider \ntheir disclosure on all emerging issues, including risks that may affect their long-term \nsustainability. And as they do so I would suggest they ask themselves whether their \ndisclosure is sufficiently detailed to provide insight as to how management plans to mitigate \nmaterial risks and how their decisions in the area of risk could be material to the business and \ntheir investors. Again, this is a process where I believe it is helpful to think about how \nmanagement engages with board members on the topic. […] \nOne item the 2010 guidance does not touch upon is the board’s risk management role in \nthis area. Item 407(h) of Regulation S-K[10] and Item 7 of Schedule 14A require a company \nto disclose the extent of its board’s role in the risk oversight of the company, such as how the \nboard administers its oversight function and the effect this has on the board’s leadership \nstructure. The Commission has previously highlighted that this should provide investors with \nimportant information about how a company perceives the role of its board and the \nrelationship between the board and senior management in managing the material risks facing \nthe company. To the extent a matter presents a material risk to a company’s business, \nthe company’s disclosure should discuss the nature of the board’s role in overseeing the \nmanagement of that risk. The Commission last noted this in the context of cybersecurity, \nwhen it stated that disclosure about a company’s risk management program and how the \nboard engages with the company on cybersecurity risk management allows investors to better \nassess how the board is discharging its risk oversight function. Parallels may be drawn to \nother areas where companies face emerging or uncertain risks, so companies may find \nthis guidance useful when preparing disclosures about the ways in which the board \nmanages risks, such as those related to sustainability or other matters».  \n Finally, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in March 2019204 about human capital reporting:  \n«As I mentioned previously, I believe the Commission’s disclosure requirements and \ndisclosure guidance must be rooted in the principles of: (1) materiality; (2) \ncomparability; (3) flexibility; (4) efficiency; and (5) responsibility. I also believe that our \ndisclosure requirements and guidance must evolve over time to reflect changes in markets \nand industry while being true to these principles, which in well-designed rules can be \nmutually reinforcing. \nTurning to human capital, I believe that the strength of our economy and many of our public \ncompanies is due, in significant and increasing part, to human capital, and for some of those \ncompanies human capital is a mission-critical asset. Disclosure should focus on the material \ninformation that a reasonable investor needs to make informed investment and voting \ndecisions; yet, applying this and the other principles I mentioned to human capital in the \n                                                           \n204 https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/clayton-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-032819  \n\n-268- \n \nway businesses assess and disclose, and investors evaluate, for example, revenue or costs \nof goods sold, is not a simple task. That said, the historical approach of disclosing only the \ncosts of compensation and benefits often is not enough to fully understand the value and \nimpact of human capital on the performance and future prospects of an organisation. \nWith that as context, my view is that to move our framework forward we should not \nattempt to impose rigid standards or metrics for human capital on all public companies. \nRather, I think investors would be better served by understanding the lens through which each \ncompany looks at its human capital. In this regard, I ask: what questions do boards ask their \nmanagement teams about human capital and what questions do investors—those who are \nmaking investment decisions—ask about human capital? For example, how do investors use \nhuman capital information to make relative capital allocations among similar organisations? \nArmed with general and sector-specific answers to these questions, we can better craft \nrules and guidance».  \n Provisions relating to non-financial reporting within the Dodd Frank Act \n \nIn a report published in October 2017 on the regulation of capital markets205, the US Treasury \nrecommended the removal of several information requirements imposed by the Dodd \nFrank Act (DFA) and considered \"non-material\" for investor choice, namely corporate \nsocial responsibility provisions such as those relating to conflict minerals (section 1502), \ncoal mines whose issuers are operators (section 1503), payments made to foreign states for \nresource extraction (section 1504) and the remuneration ratio (section 953 (b)). The report \nindeed underlines:  \n \n«Treasury recognizes that the original support for such provisions was well-intentioned. \nHowever, federal securities laws are ill-equipped to achieve such policy goals, and the effort \nto use securities disclosure to advance policy goals distracts from their purpose of providing \neffective disclosure to investors. If the intent is to use the law to influence business conduct, \nthen this effort will be undermined by imposing such requirements only on public companies \nand not on private companies. In addition, such requirements impose significant costs upon \nthe public companies that are widely held by all investors». In the absence of effective \nlegislation regarding the removal of these provisions from the DFA, the US Treasury \nrecommends the SEC to set up an exemption rule for SMEs.  \nIn this context, and at this stage, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in \nDecember 2017 to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to repeal section 1504 of the \nDFA on payments to foreign governments for natural resource extraction.  \n \nAdditional elements \n Three statutory forms of mission enterprise (Benefit Corporation and, more marginally, \nthe Social Purpose Corporation and the Public Benefit Corporation) have been gradually \nintroduced in the United States, reversing the concept of fiduciary duty in American law. \nIndeed, until now, American corporate law has focused on the pursuit of profit \nmaximization by companies for shareholders (i.e. the fiduciary duty of American \nexecutives).  \n \n                                                           \n205 U.S Department of Treasury, A Financial System That Creates Opportunities – Capital Markets, October \n2017. Available online. \n\n-269- \n \nIn 2010, with the creation of the Benefit Corporation status, American corporate law \nunderwent a certain transformation within the thirty states that have adopted this hybrid \nstatus, halfway between a traditional company and a non-profit association. Benefit \nCorporations are required to pursue a specific mission in order to achieve a general public \nbenefit (public material benefit, namely: \"a material, positive impact on society and the \nenvironment, as measured by a third-party standard, through activities that promote a \ncombination of specific public benefits\") and undertake to identify certain specific non-\nprofit objectives, known as specific public benefits, including environmental preservation \nand the improvement of human health. In order to qualify as a Benefit Corporation (the \ncreation of a Benefit Corporation being a voluntary act), the company must meet three \nconditions: (i) create a public material benefit, which it must ensure outweighs its \nfinancial interests; (ii) take into account the impact of decisions taken by the company's \ngovernance bodies on stakeholders; and (iii) publish an annual report on its social and \nenvironmental performance.  \n \nAn important feature of Benefit Corporations is the obligation of managers to consider the \ninterests of the different stakeholders (i.e. stakeholder theory as the dominant theoretical \nframework for CSR), as well as any other relevant factors when making decisions in the \nbest interests of the company (according to the Maryland State Company Code, for \nexample: \"a third-party standard is defined as a recognized standard for defining, \nreporting and assessing overall corporate social and environmental performance\"). This \nspecific status also allows the manager to be protected in the event that he wishes to \npursue a specific CSR mission in addition to the pursuit of financial profit (legitimization \nof the societal mission): he is thus relieved of any liability in the event of financial \ndamage as long as his decisions have been taken in good faith in the general interest and \nin a prudent manner (legal protection against non-financial decisions associated with the \nrules of transparency and accountability). \n \n Under pressure from consumers, several private labelling initiatives are also developing in \nthe United States. The most important, through the B-Corp label, is intended to promote a \nmore committed, accountable, transparent and positive business model that has a positive \nimpact on the planet. Labelling is granted to companies that have non-financial social \nand/or environmental objectives that are in line with the required accounting and \ntransparency criteria, the creator's intention being to develop capitalism from a civic \nperspective. B-Corp certification is managed by an NGO, called B Lab and created in \n2007: in order to obtain the B-Corp Label, which is reassessed every two years, a \ncompany must obtain a sufficient number of points on a 200-question questionnaire \ncovering various topics such as governance, stakeholders, the economic model, \naccounting, staff, salaries, ecological impacts, etc. It should be noted that the B-Corp label \nalso has a community and participatory dimension: the B-Corp community thus meets in \nworking groups and reflection groups to improve its practices. Since its creation, the B-\nCorp label has also created a business community present in 40 countries and comprising \nmore than 1,600 certified companies.  \n \n \n \n\n-270- \n \nCANADA \n \nExisting regulations and recommendations \n1. Accounting Standards Board (AcSB)206: publication of a performance reporting \nframework \n \nAs part of its work on the quality and relevance of financial information, AcSB participates in \ndiscussions on sustainable finance, taking into account environmental and social issues and \npublished in December 2018 a framework for measuring performance reporting that is not \nmandatory. This framework is not limited to traditional financial reporting and includes \nrecommendations on non-Gaap financial reporting, and any other relevant non-financial \ninformation that could be useful in measuring performance (example given in paragraph \n24)207. \nThis framework seeks to specify the qualities of the information required and gives the main \nprinciples for drawing up its information (materiality, constraints on cost/benefit analysis, \nchoice of performance areas) and the characteristics of the information sought: relevance, \nfaithful depiction, consistency, comparability, verifiability, timeliness, understandability, \nwhich are the same characteristics of financial information as those provided by the IASB in \nits conceptual framework. This performance reporting framework therefore remains based on \nprinciples to be followed, and it is up to the company or organisation to establish the content \nof its own reporting. \n \n2. Recommendations issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) \n \nThe CSA brings together the capital markets regulators of Canada's ten provinces and three \nadministrative territories and is responsible for ensuring investor protection and market \nintegrity in their jurisdictions208. As such, the CSA makes recommendations to listed \ncompanies on the presentation of disclosure. Companies should therefore refer to: \n \n National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations, Part 5 on Management, \nDiscussion and Analysis, dated 2011 and may be considered as part of the management \nreport of the governing bodies. However, no content details are given.  \n CSA Staff Notice 51-333 Environmental Reporting Guidance, published on 27 October \n2010, provides recommendations for reporting environmental information. Since the main \nobjective is to assess climate risk, the recommendations are qualitative on the different \ntypes of risks, the way they are monitored and the potential impacts. Many examples \nillustrate the different types of possible risks, but no mention is made of the use of specific \nstandards. Forward-looking information is also required (expected target) \n                                                           \n206 The Accounting Standards Board (AcSB) is an independent body with the authority to establish accounting \nstandards for use by all Canadian entities outside the public sector. \n207 Non-financial or operational measures: number of volunteers, employees, members, active users or new \nstores, and performance ratings on production output, client service, safety and reliability. \n208 The market regulators of Canada's ten provinces and three territories are united in the Canadian Securities \nAdministrators Association, which aims to provide Canada with a harmonized securities regulatory framework. \nThis association has three objectives: (i) investor protection; (ii) the maintenance of fair, efficient and transparent \nmarkets; and (iii) the reduction of systemic risk. Within this framework, provincial and territorial authorities \ncollaborate on the design of common regulations and programs. In particular, a passport system has been put in \nplace, allowing market participants to access the markets of all provinces and territories concerned by dealing \nonly with the market authority of the province in which their head office is located. \n\n-271- \n \n CSA Staff Notice 51-354 Report on Climate-related Disclosure Project, published on \nApril 5, 2018, provides an overview of climate practices. This is a general study on the \nregulations in force in Canada, the United States and Australia, on four of the most \nfrequently cited optional standards (TCFD, IIRC, GRI and SASB) and on the practices of \n78 Canadian groups. The report gives rise to proposals, at this stage, on a possible \nconvergence of climate reporting frameworks on the TCFD recommendations. \nOther government initiative on climate change  \nThe Ministers of Environment and Climate Change and Finance established an expert panel \non Sustainable Finance in 2018 to make recommendations on climate change reporting as a \nfollow-up to the TCFD recommendations. At this stage, the consultation on the basis of an \ninterim report has been completed since the end of January and the final report is expected by \nmid-2019209. This report could be the basis for more prescriptive regulation. \n \nPrivate initiatives  \n \nThe accounting profession in Canada (CPA Canada) is very active on the subject of climate \nchange and CFTD recommendations, and has published numerous reports to this effect:  \n \n Investor Perspectives on TCFD Recommendations, (December 2018) \n Canadian Perspectives on Implementing the TCFD Recommendations, (Juillet 2018) \n Climate Change Risk, Disclosure and the Evolving Role of Auditors, 2018 \n Task Force on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD): Overview   \n State of Play: Study of Climate-related Disclosures by Canadian Public Companies, Juin \n2017 \n Climate Change Briefing: Questions for Directors to Ask, 2017 \n Climate change-related disclosure: The regulators’ perspective, Juin 2017 \n An Evolving Corporate Reporting Landscape: A Briefing on Sustainability Reporting, \nIntegrated Reporting and Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting, Juin 2015 \n Climate Change Disclosures: Building a Better MD&A, 2008  \n \nThe update of the study on climate change practices in Canadian listed companies is ongoing \nand is expected to be published in the second quarter of 2019.  \n \nAvailable practices and statistics \nThe results of the 2017 CSA study show that: 56% of issuers publish specific climate change \ninformation on a voluntary basis, the others either publish information that is difficult to \nunderstand or do not publish. Most issuers publishing climate change information indicate \nthat they apply the GRI framework. This data may have changed since then with the \nfinalization of the TCFD reports. \nOngoing actions and developments \n AsCB on the performance reporting framework: no action at the moment, pending \nfeedback following the application of the performance reporting framework. \n                                                           \n209ttps://www.canada.ca/fr/environnement-changement-climatique/services/changements-climatiques/groupe-\nexperts-financement-durable.html  \n\n-272- \n \n Significant reluctance to add additional regulatory obligations for companies, but \nrecognition of a complementary need for climate change recommendations and training. \nAn alignment with the TCFD recommendations would be possible.  \nAppendix - 20 reporting criteria \nCriteria   \n \nRelated to the Strategy \n1 \nStrategic Analysis and Action: The company declares whether or not it pursues \na sustainability strategy.

Since 2006, non-financial reporting has been incorporated into Chinese law, with the \nimpetus of state-owned enterprises210 and stock exchanges in Shenzhen and Shanghai211. The \nCSR reports of Chinese companies reflect the institutional pressures (legislation, standards, \nstakeholder expectations, etc.) that have been renewed and increased over the past decade. \nThe provisions adopted by the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges in 2006 and 2008 \ncreated an obligation for listed companies to publish a CSR report, set targets and report by \npublishing information212. In 2012, 617 listed companies published a CSR report.  \n \nThis growing requirement for non-financial reporting is accompanied by increasing \nenvironmental regulation, due in particular to pressure from civil society, significant \nenvironmental degradation (i.e. air, soil and water pollution) and a demand for greater \ntraceability of manufacturing production. A 2008 decree requires local environmental \nagencies to publish information in the press about companies that do not comply with \nenvironmental standards.  \n \nCurrent regulatory framework \n \nThe development of CSR policies and guidelines in China is mainly the responsibility of the \nMinistry of Commerce, which considers CSR as a major factor in transforming the economic \ngrowth model.  \nThere are a dozen important legislative texts structuring the legal approach to CSR \nwith, since 2002, the law on occupational safety. In 2005, the law governing company law \nin China introduced a provision on CSR. Article 5 of the Business Code states in particular \nthat \"in its operations, a company must comply with laws and administrative regulations, \nsocial morality and business ethics. It must act in good faith, accept government and public \nsupervision and bear the weight of its social responsibilities. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, several \nregulations continued this trend.  \n \nSASAC, an organisation emanating from the State Council, publishes guidelines to promote \nCSR in state-owned enterprises, foreign-invested enterprises and banks. The regulatory \nframework is strengthened by institutional action expressed through a central planning State, \nwhose orientations are given by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party \n(CCPC), which sets a guiding framework. The issues of economic transformation and \nmutation and CSR are clearly addressed. The policy of building a harmonious society is a \nreference framework for the whole country, for the local level and of course for the action of \ncompanies. Attempts at self-regulation by some professional associations complement a \n                                                           \n210 Chinese state-controlled companies are encouraged to communicate through a range of institutional \nmechanisms such as Labour Contract Law and in particular the Guidelines to the Stateowned Enterprises \nDirectlyunder the Central Government on Fulfilling Corporate Social. \n211 A report published in 2017 by Syntao Green Finance, a China-based provider of ESG data, found companies \nlisted on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have released more than 5,300 corporate social \nresponsibility (CSR) reports. Another 5,600 have been released by non-listed companies (source : \nhttp://www.fundsglobalasia.com/june-2018/esg-china-gets-serious-about-esg)  \n212 Since 2006, the law has required companies listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to publish a CSR report \n(SSE guidelines) and in 2008, the Shanghai Stock Exchange published a CSR Notice and a guide (Shanghai \nEnvironmental Disclosure Guidelines) for listed companies. \n\n-275- \n \nsystem that, in addition to a set of technical provisions, encourages companies to set \nthemselves ambitious CSR and governance objectives. \n \nOngoing developments in China \n \n By 2020, all listed companies and issuers will have to implement ESG reporting 213(CSRC \nregulations); \n There is increasing progress in ESG information collection, although China remains \nbehind214; \n There are local specificities of Chinese reporting standards that require investors to use \nlocal ESG analysts; \n There has been a significant increase in shareholder engagement; and \n There is real and growing investor pressure - particularly in that China is a leader in green \nbond issuance. \n \n \n                                                           \n213 The China Securities Regulatory Commission has introduced new requirements that by 2020 will mandate all \nlisted companies and bond issuers to disclose ESG risks associated with their operations in their annual or semi-\nannual reports: http://english.sepa.gov.cn/News_service/media_news/201706/t20170614_415970.shtml . \n214 “Nonetheless, many Chinese companies have been slow to respond to investors’ growing appetite for green \nfinance. In 2016, less than a third of China’s listed companies voluntarily published information related to their \nESG risks and impacts, and that year, the China Forum of Environmental Journalists released a report \nconcluding that only about 27% of the same companies created reports about their ESG performance. As \nrecently as 2015, Shanghai’s Fudan University found that ESG disclosures in the reports of 170 companies \nacross \n14 \nsectors \nlisted \non \nthe \nShanghai \nStock \nExchange \nwas \nunreliable” \n(source: \nhttps://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=61af067d-4fd6-4ad9-91d6-bb01037fb166).  \nhttps://www.chinadailyhk.com/articles/167/146/232/1537364876798.html  \n\n-276- \n \nJAPAN \n \nIntroductory elements on corporate governance in Japan (ongoing improvement) \n \nJapanese corporate governance has long been one of the least advanced among developed \neconomies, and significantly behind the country's level of development (OECD, 2015)215, \nboth because of the characteristics of the Japanese economic fabric (which is characterized by \nthe existence of long-standing family businesses) and the gradual divergences with Anglo-\nSaxon corporate law during the second half of the 20th century.  \n \nHowever, corporate governance remains a central element of economic competitiveness, due \nto its significant influence on access to and allocation of equity capital and the monitoring of \ncorporate performance. As a result, poor corporate governance has hampered corporate \nfinancial performance (with a significantly lower return on investment than that of European \ncompanies) and has maintained a productive investment deficit. In particular, Japan is \ncharacterized by excessive cash accumulation (i.e. hoarding liquidity on the balance \nsheet)216, which hinders companies' ability to invest and increase basic wages in a context of \nsustainable deflation (IMF, 2014217), and makes it difficult for both exports and domestic \nconsumption to recover.  \n \nAlso, the reform of the corporate governance framework is an integral part of the third \naxis of Shinzo Abe's economic strategy218.  \n \n Several measures have recently been taken to improve the governance framework for \nJapanese companies: \n \n In January 2014, the JPX-Nikkei 400 Index was launched by the Japan Exchange \nGroup to stimulate the stock market and create a more readable investment framework \nfor international investors. This index is composed of 400 Japanese companies \nselected on the basis of quantitative criteria (such as return on equity and operating \n                                                           \n215 The boards of directors of Japanese companies are characterized by their lack of efficiency and \ntransparency. They meet on average more frequently than in the United States, for example, but discuss more \nmanagement details than the company's overall strategy. In addition, several recent scandals (i.e. falsification of \naccounts, abuse of corporate assets) have highlighted this lack of governance of Japanese companies. \n216 This accumulation of cash is justified by the Japanese business environment (the legal risk and high cost of \nbankruptcy proceedings, for example, favour the holding of precautionary savings by business leaders), the \nperiod of sustained deflation in Japan (which favours the holding of liquidity) and the financial crises (1997, \n2008) which impose deleveraging processes. In addition, several studies show that in the absence of corporate \ngovernance, shareholders have a preference for liquidity hoarding (Dittmar et al. 2003). \n217 Aoyagi and Ganelli, \"Untash the cash! Corporate Governance reform in Japan\", IMF Working Paper 14/140, \nAugust 2014. \n218 As a reminder, Japan has not experienced sustained positive inflation since the late 1990s due to structural \nfactors (accelerating population ageing, slowing down of the positive effects of technological catching-up) and \ncyclical factors (lasting effects of the 1997 and 2008 crises). Following his election in December 2012, Prime \nMinister Shinzo Abe launched a new economic strategy (Abenomics), based on three axes (\"three arrows\") and \naimed at getting the Japanese economy out of deflation: (i) a fiscal consolidation path, combining short-term \nstimulus plans and medium-term fiscal consolidation; (ii) a quantitative and qualitative monetary easing \nmonetary policy (QQE) committing the Japanese central bank to a 2% inflation target (initially two years ahead - \nsubsequently extended); and (iii) a series of structural reforms, with the priority objective of restoring \nbusiness investment to its pre-crisis level and returning the economy to growth of around 2% in the \nmedium term. \n\n-277- \n \nincome) and qualitative criteria (such as the presence on the Board of at least two \nindependent external directors and the implementation of IFRS accounting standards);  \n \n In February 2014, a Stewardship Code for Institutional Investors219 was launched \nunder the aegis of JFSA and revised in May 2017220. Institutional investors221 adopting \nthe code are required to engage in a constructive dialogue with the companies in \nwhich they invest with a view to greater supervision of key corporate decisions, \nincluding regular reporting on the exercise of their voting rights in accordance with the \ncomply or explain principle;  \n \n In June 2015, a Corporate Governance Code came into force, under the aegis of \nJFSA, based on the corporate governance principles established by the OECD and the \nJapanese Companies Act revised in June 2014. It is based on five main principles: \n \n(i) \nRespect for the rights and equal treatment of shareholders (including minority \nand foreign shareholders);  \n(ii) \nCooperation with non-shareholder stakeholders (employees, customers, local \npopulation) and the promotion of diversity;  \n(iii) \nCommunication and transparency of information (especially non-financial \ninformation);  \n(iv) \nThe Board of Directors must set the main strategic orientations and ensure \neffective, independent and objective control of the company. Companies must \neffectively use at least two independent external directors222; and  \n(v) \nCompanies must engage in a constructive dialogue with shareholders.  \n \nRecent developments \n \n In its thematic review on corporate governance published in April 2017223, the \nFinancial Stability Board (FSB) concluded that all FSB member jurisdictions, \nincluding Japan, have an effective corporate governance framework. In particular, the \n                                                           \n219 Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors, « Japan’s Stewardship Code to promote sustainable growth \nof \ncompanies \nthrough \ninvestment \nand \ndialogue », \n29 \nmai \n2017. \nAvailable \nonline: \nhttp://www.fsa.go.jp/en/refer/councils/stewardship/20170529/01.pdf  \n220 This code of conduct for institutional investors is based on the UK Stewardship Code adopted in 2010.  \n221 Institutional investors have accounted for almost half of Japan's shareholding since the early 2000s, while the \nlatter has hitherto been characterized by the predominance of individual shareholders and Japanese financial and \nnon-financial companies. The \"main bank\" system, which differs from the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate \ngovernance, has allowed close links between a company and the bank holding shares in that company, favouring \nthe immobility of Japanese companies.  \n222 Japanese companies are characterized by the domination on the board of directors of individuals with close \nties to the company (e.g. long-term employees, directors from banks involved in financing the company) who \nplay a central role in decision-making (source: OECD). In June 2014, the revised Company Law had encouraged \nthe appointment of at least two independent external directors to the Board of Directors. \nIt should be noted that under Japanese company law, the external director must not have any current or past \nexperience (as a director, corporate officer or employee) in the company or one of its subsidiaries. The \nindependent director is free of interests and must not find himself in a situation likely to alter his independence \nof judgment or place him in a conflict of interest situation. As a reminder, in France, the Afep-MEDEF code \ndefines an independent director as \"a director [who] has no relationship of any kind whatsoever with the \ncompany, its group or its management that could compromise the exercise of his or her freedom of judgment\" \n(article 9.1). \n223 \nFSB, \n\"Thematic \nReview \non \nCorporate \nGovernance\", \n28 \nApril \n2017. \nAvailable \nonline: \nhttp://www.fsb.org/2017/04/thematic-review-on-corporate-governance/  \n\n-278- \n \nFSB highlighted transparency mechanisms on compensation (when it exceeds a given \nlevel), the mechanism for self-assessment by boards of directors of their performance \nand transparency to shareholders on the appointment process for members of the board \nof directors.  \n \n In its July 2017 review of Japan under Article IV, the IMF highlighted efforts to \nreform the corporate governance framework but reiterated the need to improve \nthe compliance of companies, including pension funds, with the codes that have \nentered into force. Their non-binding nature makes it essential for the Japanese \ngovernment to provide impetus to change deeply rooted corporate governance \npractices. In this sense, the IMF also recommended that the government should be \nmore ambitious in appointing external directors and in setting regulatory limits for \ncross-shareholdings224.    \n \n In this vein, the GPIF225 revised its investment principles and code of conduct in \nOctober 2017, in order to comply with the applicable conduct requirements and to \ntake into account ESG indices in its investment strategy. The adoption of principles of \ngood conduct by the GPIF is also intended to inspire managers who work under \ndelegation of GPIF management.  \n \nIn addition, in July 2017, the226GPIF announced the implementation of a passive \ninvestment strategy in three Japanese non-financial indices227 (including one \nfocusing on gender equality), allocating up to 10% of its equity portfolio to \nenvironmentally and socially responsible investments. The GPIF hopes that this new \nasset allocation strategy will encourage Japanese companies to improve their \nenvironmental and social performance while increasing their return on investment \nover the long term.  \n \n The Corporate Governance Code was revised in June 2018 by the Tokyo Stock \nExchange (TSE), based on proposals from the Committee of Experts on the \nMonitoring of the Japanese Stewardship Code and the Japanese Corporate Governance \nCode - co-chaired by JFSA and the TSE. The revision of the Code, which largely \nconcerned shareholder remuneration and the reduction of cross-shareholdings, aims to \nmake Japanese companies more attractive to foreign investors (with an increasing \nreporting requirement).  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n224 Cross-shareholdings refer to a situation in which two companies each hold a fraction of the other's capital. \nThis system flourished in Japan in the second half of the 20th century and these business conglomerates now \nconstitute a significant part of the country's industrial production.  \n The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) is the public body managing most of the public pension \nreserves and the largest fund in the world (ahead of the Norwegian oil fund, called the Global Pension Fund \nand managed by the Bank of Norway) and is among the top 10 shareholders of 99% of Japanese companies. It \nmanages approximately 157 trillion yen of outstanding amounts (September 2017 data225 - approximately \n$138 trillion) and behaves like an essentially passive fund, taking units based on the weightings of the Topix \nindex (i.e. the Tokyo Stock Price Index, the Tokyo Stock Exchange index with the Nikkei 225).  \n226 Reuters, \"Japan's GPIF expects to raise ESG allocations to 10 percent\", 14 July 2017.  \n227 GPIF, \"GPIF selected ESG indices\", July 3, 2017. Available online.  \nThe GPIF has selected three ESG indices: FTSE Blossom Japan Index; MSCI Japan ESG Select Leaders Index; \nand MSCI Japan Empowering Women Index. \n\n-279- \n \n \nExtra-financial reporting framework in Japan \n \nThe Corporate Governance Code lays the228 foundations, through general principles, for \ntaking into account long-term challenges within companies.  \n \n \n \nThe commentary to this principle underlines as follows: \n \n \n \nCompanies must therefore take appropriate measures to address sustainable \ndevelopment issues, including social and environmental issues\" (Principle 2.3). The Code \nalso emphasises that taking these dimensions into account is an integral part of corporate risk \nmanagement, with the Board of Directors being vigilant on these issues (fiduciary duty of \nthe members of the Board of Directors).  \n \nPrinciple 3 of the Corporate Governance Code also specifies the disclosure principles \napplicable to companies, including reporting on non-financial information: \"This includes \nboth financial information, such as financial standing and operating results, and non-financial \ninformation, such as business strategies and business issues, risks and governance\".  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n228 https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/news/1020/b5b4pj000000jvxr-att/20180601.pdf    \n\n-280- \n \nEvolution of non-financial reporting practices in Japan229 \n \nAccording to the CDSB and the IICRD, Japan is the second largest country in the world in \nterms of integrated reporting, given regulatory advances and the publication by the Ministry \nof Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of guidelines on value creation (Guidance for \nCollaborative Value Creation) to promote corporate transparency and dialogue between \nissuers and investors - which focuses particularly on the link between sustainable growth, \nESG integration, capital allocation strategy (i.e. measuring intangible capital). There are about \n20 mandatory ESG reporting provisions in Japan, the vast majority of which focus on \nenvironmental issues and a minority on social issues.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2017, the Japan Exchange Group joined the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative, \nestablished a committee on sustainable finance and expressed support for the TCFD's \nrecommendations. The GPIF signed the Principles for Responsible Investment in 2015 and \nsocially responsible investment grew significantly by 143% between 2016 and 2017.  \n \nIn December 2018230, METI published guidelines on the implementation of TCFD \nrecommendations in Japan, following the work of a study group on the implementation of \nTCFD recommendations launched in August 2018. These guidelines include comments on the \nTCFD's recommendations, including their relationship to the key principles of the Corporate \nGovernance Code, as well as sectoral details (automotive; iron and steel; chemical industry; \n                                                           \n229 https://docs.wbcsd.org/2019/02/Corporate_and_sustainability_reporting_trends_in_Japan.pdf  \nhttps://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/blog-view/esg-socially-responsible-investing-japan-exciting-new-era  \nhttps://esg.theasset.com/ESG/33728/financial-magazine-for-asias-decision-makers  \nhttp://www.sseinitiative.org/fact-sheet/japan-exchange-group/  \n230 https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2018/pdf/1225_006b.pdf  \n\n-281- \n \nelectronics sector; energy). It should be noted that METI states in its guidelines that it will \ndevelop guides to good practice on the implementation of TCFD, but will not revise its \nGuidance in the future.  \n \nIt should be noted that the METI Guidance explicitly refers to SASB standards as a useful \ndisclosure framework to meet TCFD requirements (page 11 of the document).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-282- \n \nAppendix 10 - Kering's Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L)  \n \nThe objective followed by Kering is to provide a measure of the environmental impact (i.e. air \npollution; greenhouse gases; land use; waste; water consumption and water pollution) of all \nthe company's activities of its own activity (i.e. production and stores) but also of that induced \nby its subcontractors (i.e. those in charge of assembly, preparation of sub-components, \nprocessing of raw materials and production of raw materials).  \n \nIt can be summarized as follows, according to the information provided by Kering to the task \nforce:  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n-283- \n \n \n \n \n\n-284- \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix 11 - Memoranda of Understanding between \"standard-setting\" bodies \n\n-285- \n \n \nThe different proposals for non-financial reporting have over time led the various actors in the \nfield to compare themselves, as well as, in particular, to highlight their common proposals.
