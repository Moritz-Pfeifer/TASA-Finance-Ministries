A working group has been tasked by the G7 \nto analyse these challenges. Its final report will be presented in October.  \n  \nAs already expressed during the meeting of G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank’s \nGovernors in Chantilly in July, France and Germany consider that the Libra project, as \nset out in Facebook’s blueprint, fails to convince that those risks will be properly \naddressed. We believe that no private entity can claim monetary power, which is \ninherent to the sovereignty of Nations. \n \nWe acknowledge that there is a need to improve the effectiveness of international \npayments. At European level, we call today on banks to work on improving European \npayment systems.  \n \nWe encourage European central banks to accelerate work on issues around possible \npublic digital currency solutions.  \n \nFrance and Germany are committed to enabling appropriate solutions to protect \ncitizens and financial stability. \n \n \n", "published_date": "2019-09-13", "section": "Communiques"}
